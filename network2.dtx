% 
% \begin{abstract}
%   This is a library of code for computations with graphic \PROP\ 
%   expressions, as needed in order to perform a Knuth--Bendix\slash 
%   Buchberger style completion on a set of identities. For the sakes 
%   of simplicity, platform independence, and purity, it is written 
%   in \Tcl.

% \section{Theory and introduction}
% 
% Best current reference for this is \emph{Network Rewriting I: The 
% Foundation}. 
% \iffalse
% The main points of deviation from the formalism there are:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     Indices (in particular head and tail indices) here start at $0$ 
%     rather than $1$, since \Tcl\ uses zero-based-indexing for lists.
%   \item
%     Transferrence matrices are stored sparsely, as lists of (the 
%     indices of) those positions which are $0$.
% \end{itemize}
% In other words, the differences are very small.
% \fi
% 
% 
% \section{Preparations}
% 
% The code is declared as a package. Commands are kept in the |network| 
% namespace (although mostly in the children of |network|).
% \begin{tcl}
%<*pkg>
package require Tcl 8.4
package provide network 2
namespace eval network {}
% \end{tcl}
% \setnamespace{network}
% 
% For some commands, test code is inlined in these sources, guarded 
% by the \Module{test} expression. These are currently not structured 
% to be extracted into a separate test file.
% \begin{tcl}
%<test>package require tcltest 2
% \end{tcl}
% 
% 
% \subsection{General utilities}
% 
% \begin{proc}{setconstlist}
%   This command sets variables to lists of the same length as a 
%   given list, but with all elements a given ``constant''. The call 
%   syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::setconstlist| 
%     \begin{regblock}[\regstar]\word{variable} \word{value} 
%     \word{list}\end{regblock}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{variable} is (the name in the calling context of) the 
%   variable to set, \word{value} is the value to use for its 
%   elements, and \word{list} is the list whose elements should be 
%   mirrored. There is no particular return value.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::setconstlist {args} {
   foreach {var val list} $args {
      set L {}
      foreach item $list {lappend L $val}
      uplevel 1 [list ::set $var $L]
   }
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% \subsection{Dictionary compatibility}
% 
% It would be possible to do a pure-\Tcl\ emulation of |dict|, but 
% the following is sufficient for my needs right now.
% \begin{tcl}
if {![llength [info commands dict]]} then {
   package require dict
}
% \end{tcl}
% 
% 
% \section{Pure networks}
% 
% The data structure employed is basically the same as in the 
% theoretical setting, but there is some duplication of information 
% (the vertices know which edges are incident to them) and indices 
% start from $0$ rather than from $1$ (to ensure that they are valid 
% \Tcl\ list indices). A \emph{network} in this package is a list
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{vertices} \word{edges}
% \end{quote}
% where \word{vertices} is the list of vertices in the network (in the 
% order of their labels) and \word{edges} is the list of edges in the 
% network (in the order of \emph{their} labels). The input vertex 
% always has label $1$ and the output vertex always has label $0$.
% 
% A \emph{vertex} is a list
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{annotation} \word{out-edges} \word{in-edges}
% \end{quote}
% where \word{annotation} is the vertex annotation (a string, which may 
% be empty only for the input and output vertices), whereas 
% \word{out-edges} and \word{in-edges} are lists of the incident input 
% and output edge labels (in the order given by their tail and head 
% respecively indices). An \emph{edge} is a list
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{head-label} \word{head-index} \word{tail-label} 
%   \word{tail-index}
% \end{quote}
% 
% Commands operating on pure networks are kept mostly in the 
% |network::pure| namespace. The intention is that namespaces for 
% other types of networks may mirror what |network::pure| provides, 
% so that in higher level code the choice of namespace to import 
% basic commands from will determine what type of networks are being 
% operated on.
% \begin{tcl}
namespace eval network {namespace eval pure {}}
% \end{tcl}
% \setnamespace{network::pure}
% 
% 
% 
% \subsection{Construction}
% 
% It's hard to do anything with networks if there aren't any to 
% operate on to begin with, so a first order of business is to 
% provide a convenient way of setting up networks.
% 
% \begin{proc}{construct}
%   The |construct| procedure constructs a network from a table of 
%   vertex types and a list of components. The syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::construct| \word{type-dict} \word{scan-list}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{scan-list} is a list of ``items'' in the network 
%   written in a top--down (input--output) and left--right (low index 
%   to hight index) manner, and \word{type-dict} is a dictionary 
%   specifying how these items should be interpreted. The return 
%   value is the result network.
%   
%   Most items are the annotation string for a vertex; in that case 
%   the corresponding entry in the \word{type-dict} is a pair
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{arity} \word{coarity}
%   \end{quote}
%   There are however also some item types which do not insert 
%   vertices, and in that case the \word{type-dict} entry is a list 
%   whose first element is not an integer. The following first 
%   elements are understood
%   \begin{description}
%     \item[\texttt{same} \word{n}]
%       The next $n$ edges are passed on to the next row. This is 
%       effectively a $\same{n}$ permutation.
%     \item[\texttt{cross} \word{m} \word{n}]
%       The next $m+n$ edges are passed on to the next row, but the 
%       first $m$ of them will be placed after the last $n$. This is 
%       effectively a $\cross{m}{n}$ permutation.
%     \item[\texttt{newline}]
%       All remaining edges are passed on to the next row, and a 
%       new is begun.
%   \end{description}
%   Unless this is explicitly overridden by the \word{type-dict}, the 
%   following items have such special meanings:
%   \begin{description}
%     \item[\texttt{.} (period)]
%       Equivalent to |same 1|.
%     \item[carriage return]
%       Equivalent to |newline|.
%     \item[line feed]
%       Equivalent to |newline|.
%     \item[\texttt{X}]
%       Equivalent to |cross 1 1|.
%     \item[\meta{k}\texttt{X}\meta{l}]
%       Equivalent to |cross| \word{k} \word{l}.
%   \end{description}
%   The \meta{k}\texttt{X}\meta{l} items are generated on the fly, 
%   but the other ones are put into the |Type| array to start with.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::construct {typedict scanL} {
   array set Type {
      . {same 1}
      X {cross 1 1}
      \r newline
      \n newline
   }
   array set Type $typedict
   set V [list {"" {} {}} {"" {} {}}]
   set E {}
   set NWin {}
   set in {}
   set out {}
%   \end{tcl}
%   |in| in the list of labels of edges going in to the current 
%   level, |out| is the list of labels of edges going out from the 
%   current level. These edges have been added to |E|, but their 
%   output ends are empty strings until they get attached to 
%   something. |NWin| similarly is the list of labels of input legs. 
%   The |i| variable is a pointer to the next |in| edge to use.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set i 0
   foreach t $scanL {
      if {![info exists Type($t)]} then {
         if {[
            regexp -- {^([1-9][0-9]*)X([1-9][0-9]*)$} $t -> k l
         ]} then {
            set Type($t) [list cross $k $l]
         } else {
            error "Unknown item type: $t"
         }
      }
      switch -- [lindex $Type($t) 0] "newline" {

%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% \begin{proc}{edgeorder}
%   The |edgeorder| procedure computes the dependence partial order on 
%   the edges of a network. The dependence is represented as an array 
%   which has an entry \meta{$e_1$}\verb*" "\meta{$e_2$} if and only 
%   if edge $e_1$ depends on edge $e_2$. The contents of these 
%   entries are irrelevant.
%   
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::edgeorder| \word{network} \word{var-name}\regopt
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value depends on whether a \word{var-name} is 
%   specified. If it is not, then |array get| of the encoding array is 
%   returned. If \word{var-name} is specified, then nothing 
%   particular is returned, but the partial order is computed in the 
%   array \word{var-name} of the calling context. It is an error if 
%   this array initially has some index which is not of the form 
%   specified above, for $e_1$ and $e_2$ being edge labels.
%

% \subsection{Canonical representation}
% 
% The canonical form of a network is a pure network, where (i)~all the 
% lists have their canonical string representation and (ii)~the vertices 
% and edges have a canonical labelling. As usual, the last point is where 
% things get tricky. Matters aren't quite as bad as for ordinary graphs 
% though, because the presence of head and tail indices have the effect 
% that isomorphisms are even in the worst case uniquely determined by 
% one vertex per component. For connected networks the uniqueness of 
% the output vertex thus suffices for fixing the complete structure, 
% but when there are isolated components then different choices are 
% possible. If there are many components then there is also the problem 
% of which order the components should be in.
% 
% The solution to the subproblem of ordering the components is to compute 
% a simplified canonical representation for each component (not 
% containing the input or output vertex), and then sort the components 
% according to this representation\Dash if it then happens that two 
% components have the same representation, then they are equal and 
% their relative order is irrelevant. The solution to the labelling 
% within a component is less straightforward; basically it will have to 
% be checked for each vertex which representation arises from giving 
% this vertex the smallest label, and then one picks the smallest of 
% these representations as canonical representation for the component. 
% This can in principle lead to a lot of work, but it is possible to 
% cut it down somewhat by only considering the vertices with minimal 
% annotation within the component; pretty often, it will be unique. 
% \emph{Most} of the time it will also be the case that an 
% |lsort -dictionary| on all component representations would pick as 
% the smallest one where the first vertex has minimal annotation, but 
% due to special cases in \Tcl\ canonical list representation this is 
% \emph{not} true in general (i.e., |lsort -dictionary| sorts a list of 
% strings and the corresponding list of one-element lists of strings 
% differently), so formally the order used to pick a minimal 
% representation of a component is: first compare annotations of first 
% vertices, then compare the complete representations.
% 
% The simplified canonical representation of a network (or component of 
% a network) is a list of vertices-and-edges, where the edges are 
% formatted as vertices (with empty annotation, one output, and one 
% input) and share a label space with these. The structure is thus
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{annotation} \word{out-neighbours} \word{in-neighbours}
% \end{quote}
% The edges are characterised in this representation by having empty 
% annotation and positive length of both \word{out-neighbours} and 
% \word{in-neighbours}. Labels are assigned via a breadth first search, 
% where one traverses first the output edges at a vertex and then the 
% input edges.
% 
% The breadth first search is practically carried out by two commands 
% \describestring[proc][network::pure::canonise]{vertex}|vertex| and 
% \describestring[proc][network::pure::canonise]{edge}|edge|, which 
% expect to be called from a context where a couple of variables 
% (which can be local) to operate on exist. The first of these is 
% \describestring[var.]{NW}|NW|, which is 
% the original network being searched through; it is not modified in 
% this process. \describestring[var.]{queue}|queue| is a list whose 
% elements are on one of the two forms
% \begin{quote}
%   |vertex| \word{label}\\
%   |edge| \word{label}
% \end{quote}
% The \word{label}s are labels in the |NW| network of a vertex and edge 
% respectively. Elements are appended to the |queue| list when new 
% canonical-network labels are assigned to things, but elements are not 
% deleted, so |llength $queue| is always the next label to assign to 
% something, and the |queue| elements give a mapping from 
% canonical-network labels to original network labels.
% 
% The opposite mapping is provided by the two arrays 
% \describestring[array]{Vcan}|Vcan| and 
% \describestring[array]{Ecan}|Ecan|, 
% whose indices are labels (vertex and edge respectively) of |NW| and 
% the entries are the corresponding labels in the canonical network (if 
% any have been assigned). Finally, \describestring[var.]{SCR}|SCR| is 
% the Simplified Canonical Representation being constructed. The search 
% is complete when |SCR| and |queue| have the same number of elements.
% 
% \begin{tcl}
namespace eval network::pure::canonise {}
% \end{tcl}
% \setnamespace{network::pure::canonise}
% 
% \begin{proc}{vertex}
%   The |vertex| procedure has the syntax
%   \begin{quote}

%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{network} is the network and \word{start} is the label

%   return value is a list
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{SCR} \word{originals}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{SCR} is the wanted simplified canonical representation 
%   and \word{originals} is a list with the same structure as |queue| 
%   above (actually the final value of that list) that gives a mapping 
%   of SCR labels to \word{network} labels.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::canonise::component_SCR {NW start} {

% \begin{proc}{labelling}
%   The |labelling| procedure is the top-level command in the 
%   |network::pure::canonise| namespace. It has the syntax
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     network::pure::canonise::labelling \word{network}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   and returns a list of four lists $V_\mathrm{c}$, $E_\mathrm{c}$, 
%   $V_\mathrm{nc}$, and $E_\mathrm{nc}$, in that order. The c-lists 
%   map noncanonical labels to canonical labels, whereas the nc-lists 
%   map canonical labels to noncanonical labels.
%   
%   The procedure starts by computing an SCR for the ``exterior 
%   component'' (i.e., the set of vertices in the same component as 
%   the input or output vertex). The vertices and edges encountered 
%   in this work appear in the proper order, even if the labels may 
%   be a little off (but that can be sorted out later).
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::canonise::labelling {NW} {
   set queue [list [list vertex 0] [list vertex 1]]
   array set Vcan {0 0 1 1}
   set SCR {}
   while {[llength $SCR] < [llength $queue]} {
      eval [lindex $queue [llength $SCR]]
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   In the typical case we now know the order of labels in the return 
%   value, but in the general case there are additional components 
%   that need to be delt with. Therefore an array |moreV| (index is 
%   |NW| vertex label, entries are irrelevant) is created to keep 
%   track of those vertices which have not yet been put into a 
%   component.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set n -1; foreach v [lindex $NW 0] {incr n
      set moreV($n) {}
   }
   foreach pair $queue {
      if {[lindex $pair 0] eq "vertex"} then {
         unset moreV([lindex $pair 1])
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   There is furthermore a list |decL| of pairs
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{annotation} \word{vertex label}
%   \end{quote}
%   which is sorted by \word{annotation}. By looking through the 
%   network in the order of this list, it is possible to identify a 
%   component by computing its SCR with respect to one vertex therein 
%   which has minimal annotation. |compL| is the list of components 
%   (the exterior component not included) which will eventually be 
%   sorted to find their canonical order.

% \subsection{\PROP py operations}
% 
% Since networks represent elements of the free \PROP, the elementary 
% operations on a \PROP\ should be available for networks (although, as 
% it turns out, these aren't directly needed for neither reduction nor 
% completion).
% 
% \begin{proc}{composition}
%   This procedure computes the composition of a list of pure 
%   networks, i.e., it places them all in sequence (with the first 
%   on the output side). The syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::composition| \word{network}\regplus
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is the resulting network. It is typically 
%   not on canonical form. It is an error if the number of outputs in 
%   one network does not match the number of inputs in the following.
%   
%   The implementation is a basic loop over the arguments, and at 
%   each round a new network is composed. The current input side is 
%   kept track of as the list |inL| of labels of input edges, in 
%   their proper order. New edges and vertices are appended to the 
%   |E| and |V| lists for the result as they are encountered.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::composition {NW0 args} {
   foreach {V E} $NW0 {break}

           [llength $inL] [llength [lindex $NW 0 0 2]]]
      }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Since edges of |NW| may fuse with edges in |E|, a generic 
%   translation is needed. The |renumEL| list maps |NW| edge labels 
%   to |E| edge labels. Vertices are relabelled by a simple offset 
%   |vOfs|.

% That the networks encode elements of the \emph{free} \PROP\ also 
% gives rise to a substitution map that replaces vertices of 
% specified types by networks.
% 
% \begin{proc}{substitute}
%   This procedure has the call syntax
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::substitute| \word{network} \word{map}
%   \end{quote}
%   where the \word{map} is a dictionary mapping vertex annotations 
%   to networks (with the same arities and coarities as vertices with 
%   the corresponding annotations). The return value is what the 
%   \word{network} becomes if one replaces every vertex whose 
%   annotation is found in the \word{map} by the corresponding 
%   network.
%   
%   With respect to the vertices, substitution is a fairly 
%   straightforward operation; each vertex gets replaced by a set of 
%   vertices, which are known from start. Edges are trickier, in that 
%   substitution can cause many edges to be fused into one (consider 
%   what happens when one replaces a vertex with a permutation). The 
%   algorithm used below first constructs all the vertices, but does 
%   not update their inputs and outputs. In a second round, the edges 
%   are constructed from head to tail by tracking the inputs of 
%   vertices.
%   
%   Tracking edges is a process on two levels. Sometimes the edge is 
%   in the base \word{network}, other times it is in a network in the 
%   \word{map}. The first part creates two tables to relate the role 
%   of a vertex in the substitution process to its identity in the 
%   result. |NWL| is a list indexed by \word{network} vertex label, 
%   whose entries are empty lists (if this vertex is not being 
%   substituted) or the network that is going to be substituted for 
%   the vertex. |VA| is an array indexed by one- or two-element lists 
%   of labels that give the corresponding vertex label in the result. 
%   Indices that are one-element lists correpond to vertices that 
%   have not been substituted. Indices that are two-element lists 
%   \word{$n$}| |\word{$k$} correspond to vertex $k$ in the network 
%   that was substituted for vertex $n$.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::substitute {NW dict} {
   array set Subs $dict
   set V {}
   set NWL {}

         lappend V $v
         lappend NWL {}

         set k 1; foreach u [lrange [lindex $NW2 0] 2 end] {incr k

%   \end{tcl}
%   The second part is a loop over all inputs of all vertices, where 
%   the loop over all vertices is a loop over all elements in |VA|; 
%   this avoids the need for a table that is the inverse of |VA|. In 
%   the loop following the edge, the main variables are |v| (label 
%   of vertex in \word{network}), |u| (label of vertex in a network 
%   being substituted, or the empty string), and |e| (label of edge). 
%   |v| and |u| identify the head vertex of the edge |e|, whereas the

% 
% \subsection{Surgery on networks}
% \label{Ssec:Regionkirurgi}
% 
% Rewriting and splicing requires that networks are taken apart and new 
% pieces inserted. For that, it is necessary that one can identify 
% specific regions within the network as the parts to detach and 
% replace with new pieces. A \emph{region} in a given network is 
% technically specified as a list with the structure
% \begin{displaysyntax}
%   \word{vertex-list} \word{output-list} \word{input-list}
% \end{displaysyntax}
% where the \word{vertex-list} is the list (in no particular order) 
% of labels of the vertices in the piece, \word{output-list} is the 
% list of labels of output edges, and \word{input-list} is the list 
% of labels of input edges. The vertices are needed because a region 
% may include entire components in the network. The outputs and 
% inputs are needed (i)~because the order of these must be specified 
% and (ii)~because regions may include stray edges that go directly 
% from input to output. The \word{vertex-list} must not include |0| 
% or~|1|.
% 
% A related concept is that of an \emph{embedding} of a network $H$ in 
% another network $G$. This is encoded as a list
% \begin{displaysyntax}
%   \word{vertex-map} \word{edge-map} \word{target-size}
% \end{displaysyntax}
% where the \word{vertex-map} is a list indexed by vertex labels in 
% $H$ giving the label of the corresponding vertex in $G$, the 
% \word{edge-map} is a list indexed by edge labels in $H$ giving the 
% label of the corresponding edge in $G$, and \word{target-size} is 
% the total number of edges in $G$. The first two elements of the 
% \word{vertex-map} are arbitrary; some procedures set them to |x| to 
% signal that it would be an error to use them as indices.
% 
% The practical difference between the two concepts is in the point 
% of view they provide of the subnetwork in question. A region 
% describes the subnetwork from the outside, fixing the boundary so 
% that another network can replace it. An embedding describes the 
% subnetwork from the inside, making it possible to speak about parts 
% of a subnetwork. Embeddings are often computed when a supernetwork 
% is constructed from a known network, and one wants to keep track of 
% features from the original network appearing in the supernetwork. 
% Embeddings and regions are to some extent interchangeable, but 
% conversions back and forth require knowledge about the networks 
% that are involved, so they should not be undertaken without good 
% reason. 
% 
% 
% \paragraph{Edge concatenation}
% 
% More formally, one could say an embedding $b$ describes a semigraph 
% homomorphism \(H \Fpil G\), whereas a region $r$ does the same up 
% to automorphisms of $H$. These homomorphism are injective on 
% vertices and inner edges, \emph{but may concatenate legs}.
% 
% ---
% 
% A more formal definition of a \word{region} as above would be that 
% it is a semigraph monomorphism, embedding one network $H$ as a 
% subnetwork of another network $G$, although that is in two ways an 
% oversimplification. To begin with, it doesn't give a mapping for 
% the edges of $H$\Ldash it only says what the boundary edges are 
% mapped to, and even that only indirectly\Dash but the edge mapping 
% can be computed as long as the domain $H$ and codomain $G$ networks 
% are known. Furthermore (and of greater practical importance), knowing 
% only $G$ still identifies $H$ up to internal isomorphism. The 
% second issue is trickier: the codomain is technically not the 
% network $G$ for which the \word{region} is given, but a subdivision 
% $G'$ of $G$, where edge $e$ of $G$ is subdivided into edges $e$, 
% $e+m$, $e+2m$, etc.~and $m$ is the number of edges in $G$. This 
% contortion is motivated as follows.
% 
% The naive definition of region (i.e., without subdivision) is 
% complicated by the general principle (which AFAICT is a good one) 
% that a splice map should be possible to express using the result of 
% said splice map\Dash that there for all \(H \sqsubseteq G\) 
% and \(\partial K = \partial H\) should exist some \(H' \sqsubseteq 
% (G \div\nobreak H)(K)\) such that \((G \div\nobreak H)(K) \div H' 
% \simeq G \div H\). Consider first a network like
% \begin{quote}
%   |network::pure::construct {y {1 1} z {1 1}} {|\\
%   |  y \r z \r y \r z \r y \r z \r y|\\
%   |}|
% \end{quote}
% Cutting out the |z|s of this network (which together constitute a 
% network
% \begin{quote}
%   |network::pure::construct {y {1 1} z {1 1}} {z z z}|
% \end{quote}
% ) and replacing them with identities (collectively a network
% \begin{quote}
%   |network::pure::construct {y {1 1} z {1 1}} {. . .}|
% \end{quote}
% ) reduces this to
% \begin{quote}
%   |network::pure::construct {y {1 1} z {1 1}} {|\\
%   |  y \r y \r y \r y|\\
%   |}|
% \end{quote}
% In order to be able to restore the original network, it must 
% therefore be possible to describe regions containing isolated edges. 
% This can be conveniently expressed by listing the same edge label as 
% input and output.
% 
% A second complicating principle, which is quite essential to the 
% whole theory, is that vertex-disjoint parts of a network should 
% be possible to replace independently of each other (this is 
% effectively the idea that $G \div H_1 \div H_2$ at all exists). As 
% it in the above network
% \begin{quote}
%   |network::pure::construct {y {1 1} z {1 1}} {|\\
%   |  y \r z \r y \r z \r y \r z \r y|\\
%   |}|
% \end{quote}
% is possible to replace the two middle |y|s by |z| and |z \r y| (in 
% terms of the subnetworks,
% \begin{quote}
%   |network::pure::construct {y {1 1} z {1 1}} {y y}|
% \end{quote}
% by
% \begin{quote}
%   |network::pure::construct {y {1 1} z {1 1}} {z z \r . y}|
% \end{quote}
% ) to yield
% \begin{quote}
%   |network::pure::construct {y {1 1} z {1 1}} {|\\
%   |  y \r z \r z \r z \r z \r y \r z \r y|\\
%   |}|
% \end{quote}
% the same thing must be possible in
% \begin{quote}
%   |network::pure::construct {y {1 1} z {1 1}} {|\\
%   |  y \r y \r y \r y|\\
%   |}|
% \end{quote}
% and result in 
% \begin{quote}
%   |network::pure::construct {y {1 1} z {1 1}} {|\\
%   |  y \r z \r z \r y \r y|\\
%   |}|
% \end{quote}
% Note that the two |y|s in this case are not adjacent in the 
% subnetwork being replaced, although they are adjacent in the 
% network where the replacement takes place. Regions must thus be 
% able to adress the ends of an edge separately, as well.
% 
% This gets even messier if one insterts an extra stage in which the 
% two |y|s are first replaced by identities (to yield
% \begin{quote}
%   |network::pure::construct {y {1 1} z {1 1}} {y y}|
% \end{quote}
% ) and then these two identities are replaced by |z| and |z \r y| 
% as above, as this should result in the same network as before; the 
% |z| is apparently replacing one part of the middle edge, whereas 
% the |z \r y| is replacing another, subsequent part. Still more 
% tricks can be played, and the outcome is that any edge can be 
% considered a remnant of an arbitrarily long path, in which any 
% subset of vertices must be possible to reinsert. A region can thus 
% contain as separate components (i)~the tail of an edge, (ii)~the 
% head of an edge, and (iii)~any number of disjoint pieces in 
% between. It is furthermore necessary to encode the relative order of 
% the middle pieces, as this is of importance when different things 
% are substituted for them! This requires a slight extension of the 
% \word{output-list} and \word{input-list}.
% 
% The solution used is to make the elements of the \word{output-list} 
% and \word{input-list} be integers on the form $l + mi$, where $m$ 
% is the number of edges in the \word{network} and \(l < m\) is the 
% actual label of the underlying edge. $i$ is an index for the 
% piece in this region of the edge, starting at $0$ for the piece 
% closest to the tail side. An input and an output with the same $i$ 
% value are thus connected (from input to output), whereas there is 
% a cut between output $l+mi$ and input $l+mi+m$. Following these 
% instructions is luckily rather easy when one gets down to it 
% (constructing them may be a different matter).

%   (with unassigned elements set to negative numbers). The |EA| array

%   Again the algorithm focuses on the vertices, simply copying the

%   these. The |IA| and |OA| arrays map \word{network} edge labels 
%   (which in the case of |IA| may include an edge-piece index term) 
%   to input and output indices for the corresponding leg in the 
%   induced subnetwork. The |IL| and |OL| lists are the

%   still is over the vertices. There is a |VA| array with indices of 
%   the form |0,|\meta{label} and |1,|\meta{label} that maps 
%   operand vertex labels to result vertex labels; a vertex has 
%   been created (with all sublists of their final length) if it has 
%   an entry in this array.
%   
%   The main idea in the algorithm is to look at a vertex and follow 
%   all edges out from it to the next vertex. An auxilliary idea is 
%   to split the |0| and |1| vertices of $G$ into two parts, where 
%   what gets left in |0| and |1| keeps track of edges connected to 
%   $H$ (with identical head--tail indices) and two new vertices keep 
%   track of what will become the output and input vertices of the 
%   result.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::annex {args} {
   if {[llength $args] != 2} then {
      return -code error "wrong # args: should be \"[
         lreplace [info level 0] 1 end G H
      ]\""
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   In the main loop, there is no practical difference between $G$ and 
%   $H$. Hence it is convenient to have a list of these two parts and 
%   let a |part| variable containing an index specify the operand 
%   currently considered.
%   
%   The following splits vertices |0| and |1|.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set V [lindex $args 0 0]
   set VA(0,[llength $V]) 0
   set L [lindex $V 0 2]
   set n [expr {[llength $L] - [llength [lindex $args 1 0 1 1]]}]
   set np [expr {$n-1}]
   foreach e [lrange $L 0 $np] {lset args 0 1 $e 0 [llength $V]}
   lappend V [list "" {} [lrange $L 0 $np]]
   lset V 0 2 [lrange $L $n end]
   foreach e [lindex $V 0 2] {
      lset args 0 1 $e 1 [expr {[lindex $args 0 1 $e 1] - $n}]
   }
   set VA(0,[llength $V]) 1
   set L [lindex $V 1 1]

   set np [expr {$n-1}]
   foreach e [lrange $L 0 $np] {lset args 0 1 $e 2 [llength $V]}
   lappend V [list "" [lrange $L 0 $np] {}]

   foreach e [lindex $V 1 1] {
      lset args 0 1 $e 3 [expr {[lindex $args 0 1 $e 3] - $n}]
   }
   lset args 0 0 $V
   set V [lrange $V end-1 end]
%   \end{tcl}
%   The last command set up preliminary contents for the result output 
%   and input vertices, to be consistent with the initialisations of 
%   |VA|. Now the main loop will take care of everything!
%   \begin{tcl}
   set E {}
   foreach part {0 1} {
      set n 1; foreach v [lrange [lindex $args $part 0] 2 end] {incr n
         if {![info exists VA($part,$n)]} then {
            set VA($part,$n) [llength $V]

         }
         set i -1; foreach l [lindex $v 1] {incr i
%   \end{tcl}
%   The following is the main part of the main loop: follow one 
%   out-edge through to the vertex at the other end (which gets created 
%   if necessary), make the vertices point to the edge, and create it. 
%   The while loop is sure to terminate (unless the networks are 
%   inconsistent) even if the annexing creates a closed loop edge 
%   (which can happen for inappropriate arguments) because the edges 
%   looked at begin in a vertex and must therefore also end in a 
%   vertex. Closed loop edges are silently forgotten.
%   \begin{tcl}

% \begin{proc}{replace}
%   For completeness, here is a procedure for replacing a region in a 
%   network, thus computing $(G \div\nobreak H)(K)$. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::replace| \word{network $G$} \word{region} 
%     \word{network $K$}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is the result network.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::replace {G region K} {
   if {[llength [lindex $region 1]] != [llength [lindex $K 0 0 2]]}\ 
   then {
      error "Wrong number of outputs in replacement network"
   }
   if {[llength [lindex $region 2]] != [llength [lindex $K 0 1 1]]}\ 
   then {
      error "Wrong number of inputs in replacement network"
   }
   annex [detach $G $region] $K
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{forward_region}
%   The |forward_region| procedure pushes a region forward over an 
%   embedding, returning the corresponding region in the embedding's 
%   target network. The call syntax is
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     |network::pure::forward_region| \word{embedding} \word{region}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   
%   This is mostly a matter of translating the \word{region} labels 
%   using the \word{embedding}, but there is a slight complication in 
%   that an edge may be composed from several segments. Therefore the 
%   first step collects pairs `\word{embedding-label} 
%   \word{region-label}' by the real target edge to which they refer 
%   in the |E| array. Then the |P| array, which maps such pairs to 
%   final edge-segment labels, is filled in accordingly.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::forward_region {emb reg} {
   set mg [lindex $emb 2]
   set mh [llength [lindex $emb 1]]
   foreach L [list [lindex $reg 1] [lindex $reg 2]] var {p0L p1L} {
      set $var {}
      foreach eh $L {
         set eg [lindex $emb 1 [expr {$eh % $mh}]]

% \subsection{Decomposing networks}
% 
% For some applications, it is important to take networks apart into 
% smaller pieces (while still keeping these pieces natural).
% 
% \begin{proc}{inner_components}
%   This procedure decomposes a network into its components with 
%   respect to internal edges. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |inner_components| \word{network}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is a list
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     \word{$\sigma$} \word{components} \word{k} \word{$\tau$}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are permutations, $k$ is an integer, 
%   and \word{components} is a list of networks. These are such that
%   \begin{equation*}
%     \sigma \cdot \left( 
%     \bigotimes_{G \in \text{\word{components}}} G 
%     \otimes \phi(\same{k}) \right) \cdot \tau
%   \end{equation*}
%   is equivalent to the original \word{network}.
%   
%   The components appear in vertex label order, so the first 
%   contains vertex $2$, the second the minimal vertex which is not 
%   in the first, and so on. The permutations $\sigma$ and $\tau$ 
%   does not change the relative order of edges within a component; 
%   this helps to avoid \emph{creating} crossings.
%   
%   The first step is a loop to determine to which component the 
%   various vertices and edges should belong, but one might as well 
%   use it to construct the components since mapping one anyway 
%   requires visiting all its vertices and edges. |CL| is thus the 
%   list of components being constructed, in the form of finished 
%   networks. |V| and |E| are lists of vertices and edges in the 
%   component currently being constructed; these are at first not so 
%   finished. |queue| is a list of items, in one of the forms
%   \begin{quote}
%     |vertex| \word{original-label}\\
%     |edge| \word{original-label}
%   \end{quote}
%   to add to the component. The |Vto| and |Eto| arrays are indexed by 
%   original-label and map this to the pair of component number and 
%   new label; entries are added to these arrays when they have been 
%   added to |V| or |E|. The data in the |base| and |baseL| variables 
%   are used later when constructing $\tau$; it is the offset from 
%   component input indices to full tensor product input indices.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::inner_components {NW} {
   array set Vto {0 {x 0} 1 {x 1}}
   set CL {}
   set base 0
   set baseL {}
   set outLL {}
   for {set u 2} {$u < [llength [lindex $NW 0]]} {incr u} {
      if {[info exists Vto($u)]} then {continue}
      set V {x x}
      set E {}
      set queue [list [list vertex $u]]
      for {set n 0} {$n < [llength $queue]} {incr n} {
         foreach {type label} [lindex $queue $n] break
         switch -- $type "vertex" {
            if {[info exists Vto($label)]} then {continue}
            lappend Vto($label) [llength $CL] [llength $V]
            lappend V [lindex $NW 0 $label]
            foreach e [concat [lindex $V end 1] [lindex $V end 2]] {
               lappend queue [list edge $e]
            }
         } "edge" {
            if {[info exists Eto($label)]} then {continue}
            lappend Eto($label) [llength $CL] [llength $E]
            lappend E [lindex $NW 1 $label]
            lappend queue [list vertex [lindex $E end 0]]\
              [list vertex [lindex $E end 2]]
         }
      }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Finishing the vertices means updating the edge labels. In the 
%   case of the external vertices it also means updating head or tail 
%   indices, since these are generally not the same.
%   \begin{tcl}
      set V2 {}
      set Lo {}
      set outL {}
      foreach e [lindex $NW 0 0 2] {
         if {[info exists Eto($e)] &&\
           [lindex $Eto($e) 0]==[llength $CL]} then {
            lset E [lindex $Eto($e) 1] 1 [llength $Lo]
            lappend Lo [lindex $Eto($e) 1]
            lappend outL $e

            lappend Li [lindex $Eto($e) 1]
         }
      }
      lappend V2 [list {} $Li {}]
      lappend baseL $base
      incr base [llength $Li]
      foreach v [lrange $V 2 end] {
         set v2 [lrange $v 0 0]
         set Lo {}
         foreach e [lindex $v 1] {lappend Lo [lindex $Eto($e) 1]}
         lappend v2 $Lo
         set Li {}
         foreach e [lindex $v 2] {lappend Li [lindex $Eto($e) 1]}
         lappend v2 $Li
         lappend V2 $v2
      }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Finishing the edges conversely means updating the vertex labels 
%   of the endpoints. Here it is useful to have |0| and |1| in the 
%   |Vto| array.
%   \begin{tcl}
      set E2 {}
      foreach e $E {
         lappend E2 [list [lindex $Vto([lindex $e 0]) 1] [lindex $e 1]\
           [lindex $Vto([lindex $e 2]) 1] [lindex $e 3]]
      }
      lappend CL [list $V2 $E2]
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Next comes the construction of $\tau$. This follows the original 
%   list of network inputs and stores a list of old edge labels for 
%   stray edges in the |E| variable.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set E {}
   set tau {}
   foreach e [lindex $NW 0 1 1] {
      if {[info exists Eto($e)]} then {
         lappend tau [expr {[lindex $baseL [lindex $Eto($e) 0]] +\
           [lindex $CL [lindex $Eto($e) 0] 1 [lindex $Eto($e) 1] 3]}]
      } else {
         lappend tau [expr {$base + [llength $E]}]
         lappend E $e
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   The sought $k$ is now the length of |E|. Finally there is the 
%   construction of $\sigma$, which employs the per-component list 
%   |outLL| of old-labels of output edges.
%   \begin{tcl}
   lappend outLL $E
   set sigma {}
   foreach outL $outLL {
      foreach e $outL {
         lappend sigma [lindex $NW 1 $e 1]
      }
   }
   return [list $sigma $CL [llength $E] $tau]
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% The following aims to discover natural blocks in a network which 
% have low connectivity to the rest of it. One important application 
% of this is the evaluation of networks as expressions in some \PROP, 
% since the complexity of the basic operations on elements of a 
% linear \PROP\ tends to grow exponentially with the arities and 
% coarities involved. If natural blocks in the network can be found 
% an exploited as subexpressions then the number of operations on the 
% full width of the network can usually be reduced, and sometimes the 
% maximal width with which one has to deal can be reduced as well.
% 
% The primary concept used is that of a \emph{sparsest cut} in the 
% network: one for which 
% \begin{equation}
%   \Phi(S) = \frac{ 
%     \Bigl\lvert \setOf[\big]{ uv \in \GE(G) }{ u \in S, v \notin S }
%     \Bigr\rvert
%   }{ \min\bigl\{ \lvert S\rvert, \lvert \GV(G) \setminus S \rvert
%     \bigr\rvert
%   }
%   \qquad\text{for \(S \subseteq \GV(G)\)}
% \end{equation}
% (proportion of edges in cut to vertices in the smaller partition 
% created by the cut) attains its minimum. Computing this is NP-hard, 
% but efficient polynomial approximation methods 
% exist~\cite{AroraLeeNaor}, although they involve solving a 
% semidefinite program. At least to start with, a straightforward 
% enumeration will probably suffice.
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{sparsest_cut}
%   This procedure computes the sparsest nontrivial cut in a network, 
%   and returns it in the form of a region. The call syntax is merely
%   \begin{quote}
%     |sparsest_cut| \word{network}
%   \end{quote}
%   The algorithm is a straightforward enumeration, with a few 
%   restrictions on the regions that are considered:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item
%       The region must be connected, since if a nonconnected region 
%       attains the minimum then it must be a union of two regions 
%       which both attain the minimum. In such situations, one would 
%       probably rather want to find one of these components.
%     \item
%       The region must contain at least two vertices, since the 
%       single vertex cuts are often uninteresting and anyway easy to 
%       compute separately, nor may it be the entire network.
%     \item
%       The region contains all intervals between region vertices; no 
%       path in the network may intersect the region more than once. 
%       This ensures that the region can be contracted to a vertex.
%   \end{itemize}
%   If such a region exists then the sparsest such region is returned, 
%   otherwise the result is an empty list is returned. The general 
%   case in which no such region exists is that the network is a 
%   tensor product of networks with at most one component each.
%   
%   When computing the sparsity of a cut, the two external vertices 
%   $0$ and $1$ (which may never be in the region, but matter for 
%   regions of more than half of the network) count as one vertex. 
%   This gives a nice symmetry to the nontriviality condition: the 
%   numerator in the sparsity calculation must be at least $2$.
%   
%   At the outermost level, the algorithm is a loop over the minimal 
%   label $v_0$ of a vertex in the region; this vertex is taken as 
%   the seed from which the region is grown. Within this is the loop 
%   over partial regions containing $v_0$; unprocessed partial 
%   regions are kept in a stack and each processing step decides 
%   whether one vertex adjacent to the partial region should be made 
%   part of it or not. The |stack| elements are lists with the 
%   structure
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     \word{vertex-list} \word{vertex-states} \word{out-edges} 
%     \word{in-edges} \word{down-edges} \word{up-edges}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where \word{vertex-list}, \word{out-edges}, and \word{in-edges} 
%   are what will become the region. The \word{vertex-states} is a 
%   list indexed by vertex label, whose entries are |1|, |-1|, or |0| 
%   depending on whether the vertex is in the region, not in the 
%   region, or undecided respectively. The \word{down-edges} and 
%   \word{up-edges} are edges on the out-side or in-side respectively 
%   boundary of the partial region, for which it has not yet been 
%   determined whether they should be in the cut or not.
%   
%   \begin{proc}{sparsest_cut,exclude}
%     The |sparsest_cut,exclude| procedure is a helper of 
%     |sparsest_cut| which updates the \word{vertex-states} list with 
%     the information that something is outside the region. The call 
%     syntax is
%     \begin{quote}
%       |sparsest_cut,exclude| \word{network} \word{vertex-states} 
%       \word{vertex} \word{direction}
%     \end{quote}
%     where the \word{direction} is |down| or |up|, depending on 
%     which direction we're going in. The return value is a modified 
%     \word{vertex-states} list, where some |0| elements can have 
%     been changed to |-1|, or an empty list if there turned out to 
%     be some |1| in the requested direction.
%     \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::sparsest_cut,exclude {NW vstate v dir} {
   switch -- $dir "down" {
      set vi 1

}
%     \end{tcl}
%     It is important that the set of excluded vertices always is the 
%     union of an up-set (filter) and a down-set (ideal), since 
%     detection of violations of the ``region contains its 
%     intervals'' conditions relies on this; the set of vertices to 
%     which the region cannot be extended because of this condition 
%     is simply the set of vertices which are already excluded.

%   The first step for a partial region is to look at its active 
%   boundary and pick a vertex to make a choice for. Concretely, the 
%   vertex is picked which has the largest number of neighbours 
%   within the region, since this feels like it should be a good 
%   strategy. While examining the active boundary, one may however 
%   discover that some edges are in fact no longer active, so |upL| 
%   and |downL| are rebuilt while we're at it.
%   \begin{tcl}
         set upL2 {}
         set downL2 {}
         array unset next
         foreach e $downL {
            set v [lindex $NW 1 $e 0]
            switch -- [lindex $vstate $v] -1 {
               lappend outL $e
            } 0 {
               lappend downL2 $e
               lappend next($v) $e down
            }
         }
         foreach e $upL {
            set v [lindex $NW 1 $e 2]
            switch -- [lindex $vstate $v] -1 {
               lappend inL $e
            } 0 {
               lappend upL2 $e
               lappend next($v) $e up
            }
         }
         if {![array size next]} then {
%   \end{tcl}
%   We're out of active edges, so apparently the region is complete. 
%   Time to compute its sparsity and compare it to the best so far.
%   \begin{tcl}
            set order [expr {[llength [lindex $NW 0]]\
              - [llength $vL] - 1}]
            if {$order>[llength $vL]} then {set order [llength $vL]}
            if {$order<2} then {continue}
            set s [expr {double([llength $inL] + [llength $outL]) /\
              $order}]
            if {$s < $best_sparse} then {
               set best_region [list $vL $outL $inL]
               set best_sparse $s
            }
            continue
         }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Otherwise it's time to pick a vertex $v_1$ to exclude from the 
%   region or expand the region with.
%   \begin{tcl}
         set maxdeg 0
         foreach {v L} [array get next] {
            if {$maxdeg<[llength $L]} then {
               set maxdeg [llength $L]
               set v1 $v
            }
         }
%   \end{tcl}
%   First the case of excluding $v_1$ (although due to the |stack| 
%   structure, the corresponding branch of the search tree will be 
%   processed last). The stack entry is somewhat dirty in that edges 
%   which are deactivated by this will still show appear in the 
%   active lists, but this gets cleaned up in the processing of that 
%   entry. Besides, it would be difficult to deactivate all edges 
%   explicitly since not all of them need to go to $v_1$.
%   \begin{tcl}
         set L [sparsest_cut,exclude $NW $vstate $v1\
           [lindex $next($v1) 1]]
         if {[llength $L]} then {
            lappend stack [list $vL $L $outL $inL $downL2 $upL2]
         }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Second, the case of including $v_1$. This only happens if 
%   \(v_1>v_0\), since $v_0$ is supposed to be the minimal vertex in 
%   the region.
%   \begin{tcl}
         if {$v1>$v0} then {
            lappend stack [
               list [linsert $vL end $v1]\
                 [lreplace $vstate $v1 $v1 1] $outL $inL\
                 [concat $downL2 [lindex $NW 0 $v1 1]]\
                 [concat $upL2 [lindex $NW 0 $v1 2]]
            ]
         }
      }
   }
   if {[info exists best_region]} then {
      return $best_region
   } else {
      return {}
   }
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{contract_region}
%   This procedure contracts a network region to single vertex. The 
%   call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |contract_region| \word{network} \word{region} \word{annotation}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is the modified \word{network}. The 
%   \word{region} must not have an in-edge below one of its 
%   out-edges; failing this requirement will create a network with a 
%   cycle.
%   
%   For the moment, this is implemented as an |annex|ation. Most of 
%   the code is just for constructing a single-vertex network.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::contract_region {NW region annot} {
   set E {}
   set Li {}
   foreach i [lindex $region 2] {

      lappend Li $e
   }
   set Lo {}
   foreach i [lindex $region 1] {
      set e [llength $E]

      lappend Lo $e
   }
   set V [list [list "" {} $Lo] [list "" $Li {}] [list $annot $Lo $Li]]
   return [annex [detach $NW $region] [list $V $E]]
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{decompose_2NW}
%   This procedure takes a network with two inner vertices and at 
%   least one inner edge as argument. It returns a list with the 
%   structure
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     twopart \word{$\rho$} \word{$A$} \word{$k$} \word{$\sigma$} 
%     \word{$B$} \word{$l$} \word{$\tau$}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where $\rho$, $\sigma$, and $\tau$ are permutations, \(k,l \in 
%   \mathbb{N}\), and $A$ and $B$ are the vertex annotations. These 
%   are such that
%   \begin{equation*}
%     \phi(\rho) \circ A \otimes \phi(\same{k}) \circ 
%     \phi(\sigma) \circ B \otimes \phi(\same{l}) \circ \phi(\tau)
%   \end{equation*}
%   is equivalent to the original network.
%   
%   The first step is to sort out which vertex is which. This 
%   involves a loop over the edges, looking for one which has neither 
%   $0$ nor $1$ as endpoint.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::decompose_2NW {NW} {
   foreach e [lindex $NW 1] {
      foreach {u "" v} $e break
      if {$u>1 && $v>1} then {break}
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Now $A$ will be the annotation of $u$ and $B$ will be the 
%   annotation of $v$.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set A [lindex $NW 0 $u 0]
   set B [lindex $NW 0 $v 0]
   set k [expr {[llength [lindex $NW 0 0 2]] -\
     [llength [lindex $NW 0 $u 1]]}]
   set l [expr {[llength [lindex $NW 0 1 1]] -\
     [llength [lindex $NW 0 $v 2]]}]
%   \end{tcl}
%   The tricky part is to compute the permutations. The idea is to 
%   keep a list of edges (in order) at the top of a level, and 
%   construct the list of edges below that level when looping over 
%   the previous list.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set tau {}
   set L [lindex $NW 0 $v 1]
   set i [llength [lindex $NW 0 $v 2]]
   foreach e [lindex $NW 0 1 1] {
      if {[lindex $NW 1 $e 0] == $v} then {
         lappend tau [lindex $NW 1 $e 1]
      } else {
         lappend tau $i
         lappend L $e
         incr i
      }
   }
   set sigma {}
   set L2 [lindex $NW 0 $u 1]
   set i [llength [lindex $NW 0 $u 2]]
   foreach e $L {
      if {[lindex $NW 1 $e 0] == $u} then {
         lappend sigma [lindex $NW 1 $e 1]
      } else {
         lappend sigma $i
         lappend L2 $e
         incr i
      }
   }
   set rho {}
   foreach e $L2 {
      lappend rho [lindex $NW 1 $e 1]
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Finally construct the result.
%   \begin{tcl}
   list twopart $rho $A $k $sigma $B $l $tau
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{blocktree_decompose}
%   This procedure converts a network to a binary tree composed only 
%   of |twopart| joins and annotation leaves. The two node types that 
%   can be had are thus
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     twopart \word{permutation} \word{down-child} \word{integer} 
%     \word{permutation} \word{up-child} \word{integer} 
%     \word{permutation}\par
%     atom \word{annotation}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where the |twopart| form is as returned by the |decompose_2NW| 
%   procedure, except that \word{down-child} and \word{up-child} are 
%   again trees of this form, and each vertex of the original tree 
%   gives rise to exactly one |atom| node.
%   
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |blocktree_decompose| \word{network}
%   \end{quote}
%   where the \word{network} must be an inner component (connected 
%   after removal of extrenal vertices and edges).
%   
%   The idea is to find a sparsest cut, convert its region through a 
%   recursive call, contract it to a vertex, and repeat until there 
%   is less than three internal vertices left.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::blocktree_decompose,recurse {NW} {

% \subsection{Conversions}
% 
% The following procedures convert pure networks from and to the old 
% network format (which did not have explicit input and output 
% vertices, and embedded also a lot of graphical information). To 
% recall, the general structure of the oldstyle networks was as a 
% list
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{vertices} \word{edges} \word{legs} \word{info}
%   \word{other}\regstar
% \end{quote}
% The \word{vertices} here was a list of vertex descriptions and 
% \word{edges} was a list of edge descriptions. The \word{legs} was 
% a list 
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{output-legs} \word{input-legs} \word{other}\regstar
% \end{quote}
% where \word{output-legs} and \word{input-legs} were both lists of 
% indices into the \word{edges} list, specifying which edges are the 
% output and the input legs respectively. \word{info} was a dictionary 
% in which miscellaneous information could be stored (very little 
% actually was). Finally, the network and \word{legs} lists could 
% contain any number of the \word{other} elements, but the meanings of 
% these dependend on the commands that were operating on the network.
% 
% A \word{vertex-description} was a list
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{annotation} \word{incidence} \word{info} \word{other}\regstar
% \end{quote}
% where the \word{annotation} (as now) was a string, \word{incidence} 
% was a list of (indices of) those edges to which the vertex is incident 
% (in the order of the ports for this kind of vertex, without 
% distinction between input and output ports), and \word{info} was a 
% dictionary with miscellaneous information. As with networks as a 
% whole, the \word{other} elements were allowed, not required, and 
% completely unspecified.
% 
% An \word{edge-description} similarly was a list
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{out-vertex} \word{in-vertex} \word{info} \word{other}\regstar
% \end{quote}
% where \word{out-vertex} and \word{in-vertex} were the indices of the 
% vertices to which this edge was incident. In case this edge is input 
% leg $n$ (and its input thus is not attached to any vertex), the 
% \word{in-vertex} will be $-n-1$, and similarly in case this edge is 
% output leg $n$ (and its output thus is not attached to any vertex), 
% the \word{out-vertex} will be $-n-1$. As above, the \word{info} was 
% a dictionary with miscellaneous information and any \word{other} 
% elements were unspecified and not required.
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{from_old}
%   This procedure converts an oldstyle network to a pure network. The 
%   call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::from_old| \word{oldstyle-network}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is the generated pure network. The conversion 
%   increases all vertex labels by $2$ and preserves the edge labels.
%   
%   The actual conversion is pretty straightforward; one only has to do 
%   a bit of peeking back and forth to determine whether a vertex port 
%   is an input or an output, and to figure out the head and tail 
%   indices of an edge.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::from_old {ONW} {
   set V {}
   lappend V [list "" {} [lindex $ONW 2 0]]
   lappend V [list "" [lindex $ONW 2 1] {}]
   set label -1; foreach v [lindex $ONW 0] {incr label
      set N0 {}
      set N1 {}
      foreach i [lindex $v 1] {
         lappend N[expr {[lindex $ONW 1 $i 0] == $label}] $i
      }
      lappend V [list [lindex $v 0] $N0 $N1]
   }
   set E {}
   set label -1; foreach e [lindex $ONW 1] {incr label
      set N {}
      foreach v [lrange $e 0 1] v0 {0 1} i {2 1} {
         if {$v<0} then {
            lappend N $v0 [expr {-$v-1}]
         } else {
            incr v 2
            lappend N $v [lsearch -exact [lindex $V $v $i] $label]
         }
      }
      lappend E $N
   }
   return [list $V $E]
}
namespace eval network::pure {namespace export from_old}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% The opposite conversion is in principle a bit easier (since it is 
% not necessary to look into the list of vertices to convert an edge 
% or vice versa), but the possibility of mixing input and output 
% ports in the list of such means the pure network in itself does not 
% contain enough information to recreate the corresponding oldstyle 
% network; it is in general necessary to also have access to the 
% vertex-type array to know what is what. The entries in that array 
% are lists with the structure
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{I/O-list} \word{graphical information}
%   \word{other}\regstar
% \end{quote}
% The \word{I/O-list} specifies which positions in the 
% \word{incidences} list of this kind of vertex are inputs and which 
% are outputs. It has the same length as an \word{incidences} list, 
% and the elements are either |1| (if it is an input) or |0| (if it 
% is an output).
% 
% \begin{proc}{to_old}
%   The |to_old| procedure converts pure networks to corresponding 
%   oldstyle networks. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::to_old| \word{pure network} 
%     \word{type-array}\regopt
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is the corresponding oldstyle network (with 
%   minimal contents). If provided, the \word{type-array} argument is 
%   the name in the calling context of the vertex-type array that 
%   should be used with the oldstyle network. If omitted, it is assumed 
%   that all outputs come first and all inputs follow.
%   
%   Complementary to the |from_old| procedure, this one preserves edge 
%   labels and decreases all vertex labels by $2$.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::to_old {NW {TAvar ""}} {
   if {$TAvar ne ""} then {
      array set TA [uplevel 1 [list ::array get $TAvar]]

% \subsection{Comparing networks}
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{tree_up_comparison}
%   This procedure implements a classical comparison that is most 
%   natural for trees (coarity $1$ networks) but could also be used 
%   as a helper for more complex orders. In order for it to be a 
%   compatible order, it must consider networks where corresponding 
%   paths are of different lengths as unrelated; were it not for this 
%   it would be total.
%   
%   The call syntax is

%       \word{left root} \word{right root} \word{left network} 
%       \word{right network}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where \word{order} is the list of vertex decorations that may 
%   occur in the networks, in order from smallest to largest. 
%   \word{left root} and \word{right root} are the vertex labels for 
%   the roots of the trees to compare.
%   \begin{tcl}

%   This procedure is a generic utility for comparing things. The

%     |network::pure::grouplex_comparison| \word{left} \word{right}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{left} and \word{right} are lists of comparison

%   
%   The comparison is lexicographic with respect to the groups\Ldash

% The class of partial orders on networks that generalises the basic 
% length-lexicographic order on words turns out to be based on 
% considering all paths through the network (keeping track of inputs 
% and outputs).
% 
% \begin{proc}{compkey_paths-wdeg-lex}
%   This procedure computes a comparison key (a list of comparison 
%   groups) for a path--weighted-degree--lexicographic order on 
%   networks. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::compkey_paths-wdeg-lex| 
%     \begin{regblock}[\regstar] \word{type} \word{annot-dict} 
%     \end{regblock} \word{network}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{type} is either |weight| or |deglex| and the 
%   following \word{weight-dict} is a dictionary mapping vertex 
%   annotations to the material it contributes in the specified 
%   comparison. The return value consists of $1+w+2l$ comparison 
%   groups, where $w$ is the number of |weight| \word{type}s and $l$ 
%   is the number of |deglex| \word{type}s.
%   
%   An \word{annot-dict} maps vertex annotations to contributions 
%   from vertices with these annotations to the comparison keys of 
%   paths. Annotations not mentioned in a dict count as giving a 
%   neutral contribution, which in the case of |weight| comparison is 
%   the number $0$ and in the case of |deglex| is an empty string. 
%   The entry of an annotation is a list with the structure 
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{core} \word{output-list}\regopt\ \word{input-list}\regopt
%   \end{quote}
%   The \word{core} item is the core contribution from vertices with 
%   this annotation. The \word{output-list} and \word{input-list} 
%   are, if present, lists of additional contributions that depend on 
%   the tail and head indices of the edges that the path goes 
%   through. In the case of |deglex| dictionaries, the output 
%   contribution comes first, then the \word{core} contribution, and 
%   finally the input contribution; this corresponds to reading from 
%   the root up.
%   
%   |weight| contributions are simply added together and used as the 
%   element for this path in the corresponding comparison group. The 
%   strings formed for a |deglex| item contribute their length to one 
%   comparison group and themselves to the next group.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::compkey_paths-wdeg-lex {args} {
   set NW [lindex $args end]
   set args [lrange $args 0 end-1]
   set PathMat [list_paths_turning $NW]
%   \end{tcl}
%   The paths will within each cell of the path matrix be sorted 
%   after their comparison keys, so that the largest path is compared 
%   to the largest, the second largest path is compared to the second 
%   largest, etc. This would typically be a job for |lsort\
%   -dictionary|, but since that gets negative and fractional numbers 
%   wrong, the list is instead resorted by each element. |sortL| is 
%   the list of |lsort| command prefixes that the cell-level list of 
%   keys should be processed by, in the order they should be processed.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set pos 0
   set sortL {}
   foreach {type dict} $args {

         incr pos 2
      } default {
         error "Unknown comparison type '$type': must be deglex or\
           weight"

   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Now the first comparison group is generated. 
%   \begin{tcl}

% \begin{example}
%   The following was once thought to be a good ordering for Hopf 
%   algebra identities:
%\begin{verbatim}
% interp alias {} compare_networks {} network::pure::grouplex_compare {
%    network::pure::compkey_paths-wdeg-lex {
%       S {
%          {0 b} {{0 ""}} {{0 ""}}
%       } 
%       Delta {
%          {0 c} {{0 ""} {1 ""}} {{0 ""}}
%       } 
%       m {
%          {0 a} {{0 ""}} {{0 ""} {1 ""}}
%       }
%       epsilon {
%          {0 ""} {} {{0 ""}}
%       }
%       unit {
%          {0 ""} {{0 ""}} {}
%       }
%    }
% }
%\end{verbatim}
%   It worked fine, until the identity \(S \circ m = m \circ (1\:2) 
%   \circ (S \otimes S)\)\Ldash that $S$ is an antihomomorphism\Dash 
%   was derived. Since the left and right hand sides of this identity 
%   are unrelated by the above partial ordering, the completion 
%   failed.
%   
%   The ordering that was eventually found to work for Hopf 
%   identities turned out to be a bit simpler than the 
%   |compkey_paths-wdeg-lex| orderings, but proving it DCC was rather 
%   tricky.
% \end{example}
% 
% \begin{remark} \label{Anm:Multimangdsordning}
%   The usual method of extending a total order on a set $X$ to 
%   an order on multisets over $X$ is to compare maximal elements. 
%   For multisets $A$ and $B$, this works out as follows:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item 
%       If \(A = \varnothing\) and $B$ is not, then \(A < B\), and 
%       vice versa.
%     \item
%       Otherwise, if \(\max A < \max B\) then \(A < B\), and vice 
%       versa.
%     \item
%       Otherwise \(x = \max A = \max B\) and $A$ compares to $B$ as 
%       \(A \setminus \{x\}\) does to \(B \setminus \{x\}\), where 
%       $\setminus$ denotes multiset subtraction.
%   \end{itemize}
%   However, this is \emph{not} the ordering of multisets used in 
%   |compkey_paths-wdeg-lex|, and indeed the two are quite different. 
%   A technical reason for not using the max-element order in that 
%   procedure is that it cannot be handled within the comparison group 
%   mechanism, but needs a more complicated mechanism (with at least 
%   three list levels).
%   
%   A more mathematical reason is that it is slightly less robust 
%   with respect to composition of networks. If the order on the base 
%   set $X$\Ldash on which there must be some sort of composition 
%   operation\Dash is not strictly compatible with composition, but 
%   merely compatible with it, then the max-element multiset order 
%   need not be compatible at all. On the other hand, the ordering 
%   used in |compkey_paths-wdeg-lex| does not have that dependence 
%   since it is defined entirely in terms of non-strict inequalities.
% \end{remark}
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{list_paths}
%   The |list_path| procedure returns a matrix of lists of paths 
%   between a given output and input in a network. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::list_paths| \word{network}
%   \end{quote}
%   The first index of the return value matrix is an output index and 
%   the second index is an input index. The paths are lists of the form
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{vertex-label} \begin{regblock}[\regstar]\word{edge-label} 
%     \word{vertex-label}\end{regblock}
%   \end{quote}
%   and they appear in no particular order. There is an extra final row 
%   in the result matrix for the paths that end at an inner vertex and 
%   an extra final column in the result matrix for the paths that begin 
%   in an inner vertex.
%   
%   The idea of the algorithm is to for each edge $e$ construct all 
%   paths $P_1 e P_2$ where $P_1$ is a previously existing path 
%   ending in the head of $e$ and $P_2$ is a previously existing path

% \section{Presentations of networks}
% 
% When preparing a presentation of a network (regardless of whether 
% that presentation is as a diagram or a classical expression), it is 
% useful to have a decomposition of networks into distinct levels, and 
% then also an ordering of items within these levels (as random 
% orderings will typically lead to an excessive amount of crossings). 
% The following routines are about finding and using such orderings.
% 
% The basic format that is used for a piece of a network is a list of 
% pairs
% \begin{quote}
%   |vertex| \word{vertex-label}\\
%   |edge| \word{edge-label}
% \end{quote}
% A \emph{grading} of a network is a list of such pieces, where each 
% piece consists of what is at a vertex level of the network (a 
% grading is thus a decomposition into antichains). Edges between two 
% neighbouring levels are not listed. Edges between two levels at a 
% distance greater than $2$ appear is more than one piece.
% 
% 
% \subsection{Grading networks}
% 
% \begin{proc}{minimal_grading}
%   This procedure computes a grading of a network, in which every 
%   vertex is in the minimal level possible. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::minimal_grading| \word{network}
%   \end{quote}
%   and returns the grading. The minimal grading has all vertices 
%   of coarity $0$ at level $0$, so it is not suitable for 
%   presentations, but it suffices for certain internal applications.
%   
%   The algorithm idea is to keep a list of vertices which may be in 
%   the next level and a table (encoded as a list of |0|s and |1|s 
%   indexed by edge label) of whether the edges are available.

%   
%   The lowest level is $0$, whose lone occupant is the output vertex 
%   |0|. Levels are always integers. The output vertex |0| always has 
%   a level less than any other vertex, and the input vertex |1| 
%   always has a level greater than any other vertex. The difference 
%   to |vertex_levels| is that this procedure tries to place network 
%   parts with connections to only inputs or only outputs at extreme 
%   levels rather than centered.
%   
%   Most of the work is still carried out by |vertex_levels|; this

%   \begin{tcl}

%   The first step of this adjustment is to (again) compute the 
%   partial ordering of the vertices that is determined by the

%   It is essential for what follows that it is possible to test for 
%   a directed path between |0| or |1| and a vertex $v$ by 
%   |info exists P(0,$v)| or |info exists P($v,1)|.
%   
%   During this first step, there are also computed lists |sourceL| 
%   and |sinkL| of vertices without inputs or outputs respectively. 
%   The elements of these lists are candidates for being moved.
%   \begin{tcl}

%   \end{tcl}
%   
%   The level for a vertex $v$ placed at its low extreme is simply 
%   |$P(0,$v)|, and similarly the high extreme is |$P($v,1)| less 
%   than the level of |1|; these always exist for the vertices that

% \begin{proc}{fix_level_tongues}
%   This is a helper procedure for Yet Another Variant on the 
%   |vertex_levels| procedure, namely |vertex_levels3|. The call 
%   syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |fix_level_tongues| \word{interval-list-var} \word{network}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{interval-list-var} is the name in the calling 
%   context of the variable where the current list (indexed by 
%   vertex label) of intervals is stored. Vertices where the upper 
%   and lower bounds in these intervals are equal are said to be 
%   \emph{frozen}; their final levels have already been determined. 
%   The procedure may change this list by freezing additional 
%   vertices where appropriate. It returns the number of vertices 
%   that still remain unfrozen afterwards.
%   
%   The situation where this procedure does anything is that there is 
%   a component in the subgraph of unfrozen vertices which connects 
%   much tighter to one freezing frontier than to the other. The 
%   typical case that motivated introducing this procedure is that of 
%   a unit or counit vertex attached directly to the output or input 
%   vertex respectively, but there are currently three degrees of 
%   connectivity: no connection (|0|), connected to external vertex 
%   (|1|), or connected to an internal frozen vertex (|2|). When a 
%   component is found to have a higher degree of connectivity to one 
%   side, the whole component is freezed in a single step, by changing 
%   all upper bounds to the equal the lower bound or vice versa.

% \changes{2.2}{2008/12/06}{Linear-programming based method for 
%   assigning vertex levels. (LH)}
% 
% The approach above is adequate, but will occationally put some vertex 
% in a level that leads to more edges in the image than what looks 
% necessary, so perhaps it is time to do it properly by choosing an 
% optimal arragement. What should be minimised is the combined 
% (vertical) lengths of the edges in the network, while respecting 
% the basic restriction that the length of an edge has to be at 
% least $1$. If the variables in the optimisation problem are taken 
% to be the levels assigned to the vertices, then both the objective 
% function and the constraints are linear, so what needs to be solved 
% is really a linear program.
% 
% Recalling the basics of linear programming, we are seeking a vector 
% $\mathbf{x}$ which minimises $\mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{x}$ 
% subject to \(A \mathbf{x} \geqslant \mathbf{b}\) for some matrix 
% $A$ and (column) vectors $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c}$. The 
% inequality corresponding to an edge \(e = \overrightarrow{uv}\) is 
% that \(x_u - x_v \geqslant 1\), and \(c_u = d^+(u)-d^-(u)\) since 
% $d^+(u)$ is the number of vertices going down from $u$ and $d^-(u)$ 
% is the number of vertices going up from $u$. In principle, this is 
% all one needs to know in order to find an optimal arrangement.
% 
% In practice, one might want to add a few restrictions to get 
% results comparable to those of the other procedures above. First, 
% it was given that \(x_0 = 0\). Second, all inner vertices must be 
% at levels between those for the external vertices, so \(0 = x_0 < 
% x_u < x_1\) for all \(u \geqslant 2\); this amounts to adding extra 
% edges that have weight $0$ in $\mathbf{c}$. Third, $x_1$ is 
% minimised first and the edge length is only a secondary minimisation 
% objective; this rarely makes a difference for the result, but it 
% helps to avoid large linear programs, since vertices on a longest 
% chain get their level assigned without a need for invoking a linear 
% program solver (although linear programs can be solved in 
% polynomial time, the exponent is not particularly small).
% 
% Now then, what algorithm should be used to solve the linear 
% program? Interior point method? Ellipsoid method? No, just plain 
% old \textsc{simplex}. The main reason for this is that it gets by 
% with simpler arithmetic\Dash after imposing the above restrictions, 
% an inequality in the system has one of the three forms
% \begin{align*}

% where the lack of coefficients other than $1$, $0$, and $-1$ means 
% every corner of the polyhedron will have integer coefficients; 
% neither provably polynomial method makes do with integer 
% arithmetic. It also turns out that no matrix elimination or 
% factorisation is required to run simplex here; the relevant systems 
% are already on a form that can be solved through substitution.
% 
% Recall that the main internal state of the simplex method is the 
% \emph{working set} of inequalities; in a system with $n$ variables, 
% one selects a subset \(A' \mathbf{x} \geqslant \mathbf{b}'\) of the 
% inequality system \(A \mathbf{x} \geqslant \mathbf{b}\) such that 
% $A'$ is invertible and defines the current approximation as the 
% solution $\mathbf{x}$ to \(A' \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}'\). Consider 
% now the graph $G$ obtained from the network as follows: first add 
% edges to $0$ and $1$ from every internal vertex $u$ to express the 
% second restriction that \(0 = x_0 < x_u < x_1\), then contract all 
% non-variable vertices (those whose values were fixed by the third 
% restriction that $x_1$ is minimal) into one common reference 
% vertex. Each inequality corresponds uniquely to an edge in $G$, 
% and a set of inequalities corresponds to a linearly independent set 
% of rows in $A$ if and only if they do not form a cycle in $G$. 
% Hence a working set is the same thing as a spanning tree in $G$, 
% and every path starting in the reference vertex contains precisely 
% those edges that prescribe the current value for the variable at 
% the other endpoint.
% 
% The data structure used for keeping track of the working set is a 
% doubly-linked tree, with one node for each vertex, sitting in a 
% list indexed by vertex label. The point of using this kind of 
% structure is that it simplifies reversing the parent-child 
% relationship by having all the information available locally; some 
% such reversals typically happen at every step of the simplex 
% algorithm. Each \emph{edge} and \emph{vertex} below is a vertex or 
% edge label. The two forms for elements in the top level list are
% \begin{displaysyntax}
%   \word{parent-edge} \word{orientation} \word{children}\par
%   at \word{height} \word{children}
% \end{displaysyntax}
% where the first form is for variable vertices and the second is for 
% fixed vertices; the \word{height} is then the assigned height for 
% that vertex. The \word{children} is a list\slash dictionary with the 
% structure
% \begin{quote}
%   \begin{regblock}[\regstar] \word{child-edge} 
%   \word{child-vertex} \end{regblock}
% \end{quote}
% enumerating the tree children of this vertex. Fixed vertices other 
% than |0| are not in the tree, and their lists of children are 
% therefore empty.
% 
% The \word{orientation} is the sign of the \word{parent-edge} 
% relative to the tree; it is |1| if the edge points towards the root 
% and |-1| if it points away from it; this is also the coefficient in 
% $A$ of this edge at the node's vertex. The vertex on the parent side 
% of a \word{parent-edge} is 
% \begin{displaysyntax}
%   [lindex \word{network} 1 \word{parent-edge}
%   [expr |{|1-\word{orientation}|}|]]
% \end{displaysyntax}
% which may be fixed, and if so counts as the root when traversing the 
% tree.
% 
% One thing that one generally has to watch out for with 
% \textsc{simplex} is degenerate corners (i.e., points which 
% correspond to several working sets) since steps taken at such 
% points may be of length $0$ (switching from one tree to another, 
% but not actually moving any vertex). This is serious because the 
% basic argument for the termination of \textsc{simplex} is that the 
% objective function decreases at each step; where length $0$ steps 
% occur this argument is no longer valid, and there are indeed 
% examples in the literature where \textsc{simplex} gets stuck in 
% a loop. Degenerate corners are unfortunately rather common in this 
% setting, where all inequalities look pretty much the same.
% 
% One way to avoid this problem is to perturb the inequalities 
% slightly so that no degeneracies occur. In an algebraic setting 
% such as this, the most elegant solution is probably to subtract an 
% infinitesimal amount from the length of every edge, so that the 
% shadow of a perturbed solution is still the optimal solution to the 
% unperturbed solution. Thus, the minimal length of edge $e$ will 
% not be $1$, but $1-\varepsilon^{1+e}$, where $\varepsilon$ is some 
% positive infinitesimal; this moves all sides of the polytope 
% slightly further out, so all admissible points remain admissible. 
% Furthermore no corner of the enlarged polytope can be degenerate, 
% since its coordinates encode the corresponding working set in the 
% orders of infinitesimals that occur. In other words, there will at 
% each step always be a unique inequality which goes sharp, and no 
% step can have length $0$. This puts the matter of finding that edge 
% next on the agenda.
% 
% \begin{proc}{vertex_levels4,ypos}
%   This procedure computes the $y$-position of a vertex with respect

%     |vertex_levels4,ypos| \word{network} \word{heap} \word{vertex}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where \word{network} is the underlying network, \word{heap} is

% \end{proc}
% 
% The working set is not the only parts of the simplex algorithm that 
% gets a graph-theoretical interpretations in $G$. The descent 
% direction $\mathbf{p}$ to use if dropping the $s$'th inequality is 
% for example in general the solution to \(A' \mathbf{p} = 
% \mathbf{e}_s\), where the right hand side is the unit vector with a 
% $1$ in the $s$'th position\Dash here this $\mathbf{p}$ turns out to 
% be a vector with elements in $\{0,1\}$ or $\{0,-1\}$, and the 
% elements that are nonzero are precisely those whose path to the 
% reference vertex contains the edge corresponding to the $s$'th 
% inequality. What happens graph-theoretically is merely that the 
% tree is cut at this edge, and the branch thus separated from the 
% rest is moving in the direction of lengthening this edge. After 
% moving so far that some other edge has shrunk to its minimum length 
% $1 - \varepsilon^{1+e}$, the branch is then reattached to the base 
% tree at that position instead; a rather elementary observation.
% 
% What the general theory contributes that is not elementary is the 
% optimality (and thus termination) condition, namely that the vector 
% $\mathbf{m}$ of Lagrangian multipliers satisfying 
% \(\mathbf{m}^{\mathrm{T}} A' = \mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{T}}\) is 
% nonnegative. Since the rows of $A'$ correspond to inequalities and 
% the columns to variables, the elements of $\mathbf{c}$ are indexed 
% by vertices and the elements of $\mathbf{m}$ are indexed by edges 
% in the current spanning tree. It doesn't seem these multipliers 
% have an (easy) interpretation in general, but here they do: a 
% multiplier is the difference between the numbers of network edges 
% leaving and coming into the tree branch that would be cut off from 
% the root by the deletion of the corresponding edge, with sign 
% depending on whether the edge is oriented towards or away from the 
% root. For an edge pointing towards the root, the multiplier is the 
% number of outgoing edges minus the number of incoming edges (like a 
% $\mathbf{c}$ element), and for edges pointing away from the root it 
% is the other way around.
% 
% \begin{proc}{vertex_levels4,multipliers}
%   The command used to compute the current multipliers has the call 
%   syntax
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     |vertex_levels4,multipliers| \word{network} \word{tree-heap} 
%     \word{node-index}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where \word{network} is the network being considered, 
%   \word{tree-heap} is the list in which the working set spanning 
%   tree is stored, and \word{node-index} is an index into this list. 
%   The call computes the multpliers of all tree edges incident to 
%   vertices in the branch of which \word{node-index} is the root. 
%   The return value is a bit more than just a list of multipliers, 
%   however. Concretely it is a list
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     \word{multiplier-list} \word{up-edges} \word{down-edges}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where \word{multiplier-list} is the list of the \emph{negative} 
%   multipliers, where in turn each multiplier is stored as a list
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     \word{multiplier} \word{edge} \word{shrink-edges} 
%     \word{orientation}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where \word{multiplier} is the actual element of $\mathbf{m}$, 
%   \word{edge} is the label of the corresponding edge, 
%   \word{shink-edges} is the list of edges which shrink when 
%   \word{edge} is lengthened, and \word{orientation} is the sign of 
%   the \word{edge} relative to the tree; it is |1| if the edge points 
%   towards the root and |-1| if it points away from it; this is also 
%   the coefficient in $A$ of this edge at this vertex. The 
%   \word{up-edges} and \word{down-edges} are lists of all edges 
%   whose heads and tails respectively are in the branch. Edges within 
%   the branch are in both lists.
%   
%   The implementation is pretty straightforward: first recurse over 
%   the children to collect data, then amend with data for the 
%   current node.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::vertex_levels4,multipliers {NW heap node} {
   set multiplierL {}
   set upedgeL [lindex $NW 0 $node 2]
   set downedgeL [lindex $NW 0 $node 1]
   foreach {e v} [lindex $heap $node 2] {

      eval [list lappend upedgeL] $uL
      eval [list lappend downedgeL] $dL
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   In the equation system \(\mathbf{m}^{\mathrm{T}} A' = 
%   \mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{T}}\), every row has at most two nonzero 
%   elements, one which is $1$ and one which is $-1$. Hence the 
%   sequence of elementary column operations (since this equation 
%   system is transposed relative to the standard form) which frees 
%   the \word{multiplier} unknown is simply to add all columns for 
%   vertices in the branch together, and the same holds for the right 
%   hand side. Hence the numerical value of the multiplier is 
%   determined by the lengths of |upedgeL| and |downedgeL| together 
%   with the orientation.
%   \begin{tcl}
   foreach {edge orientation} [lindex $heap $node] break
   set mult [expr {
     ([llength $downedgeL] - [llength $upedgeL]) / $orientation
   }]
   if {$mult<0} then {
      foreach e [
         if {$orientation>0} then {set upedgeL} else {set downedgeL}
      ] {set S($e) {}}
      foreach e [
         if {$orientation<0} then {set upedgeL} else {set downedgeL}
      ] {unset -nocomplain S($e)}
      lappend multiplierL\
        [list $mult $edge [array names S] $orientation]
   }
   list $multiplierL $upedgeL $downedgeL
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% A valid objection at this point would be that 
% |vertex_levels4,multipliers| makes no distinction between network 
% edges (which contribute to $\mathbf{c}$) and other inequalities 
% (which do not)! How does that work out? Well, if one to every 
% vertex \(v \neq 0,1\) adds one input edge to $1$ and one output 
% edge to $0$ (which precisely cover all extra inequalities as $v$) 
% then the difference between input and output valency stays the 
% same, so one can use a \word{network} augmented with edges for the 
% extra inequalities also as a basis for computing $\mathbf{c}$. If 
% this is not acceptable, then one should probably rewrite that 
% procedure to explicitly require $\mathbf{c}$ as a separate vector.
% 
% \begin{proc}{vertex_levels4,shrink}
%   This procedure computes how much an the length of edge can shrink 
%   from its current value before it reaches the its minimum, and 
%   encodes that in a form that is suitable for use as a sort key. 
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     |vertex_levels4,shrink| \word{network} \word{heap} \word{edge}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   and the return value is the sort key, which should be compared in 
%   |-dictionary| mode.
%   
%   The basic algorithm is trivial: the shrink is the $y$-position of 
%   the tail of the \word{edge}, minus the $y$-position of the head 
%   of the \word{edge}, minus the minimal length $1-\varepsilon^{1+e}$.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::vertex_levels4,shrink {NW heap edge} {
   array set S {finite -1}
   set S($edge) 1
   foreach {v ""} [lindex $NW 1 $edge] sign {-1 1} {
      foreach {e c} [vertex_levels4,ypos $NW $heap $v] {
         set c [expr {$sign*$c}]
         if {[info exists S($e)]}\
         then {incr S($e) $c} else {set S($e) $c}
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   The encoding as a sort key is not so trivial. In part this is 
%   because it is optimised for sparse polynomials in the 
%   infinitesimal, and omits edges with $0$ coefficients, which 
%   conversely means edge numbers have to appear explicitly in the 
%   encoding. There is also an optimisation based on the observation 
%   that the only coefficients an infinitesimal can have are $1$, 
%   $0$, and $-1$; this is because no edge occurs more than once in 
%   the cycle formed by the tree and the \word{edge}.
%   
%   The idea is that one has to find a sequence of representations 
%   for infinitesimal terms such that $-\varepsilon < 
%   -\varepsilon^2 < \dotsb < -\varepsilon^m < 0 < \varepsilon^m < 
%   \dotsb < \varepsilon^2 < \varepsilon$ in |-dictionary| order. 
%   This is solved by using |a|--|j| as ``negative'' digits and 
%   |q|--|z| as ``positive'' digits; one starts with the digits of 
%   $m$ (padded with zeroes on the left to ensure uniform width) and 
%   maps |0| through |9| to |a| through |j| or |z| through |q| (note 
%   reversal) depending on whether the coefficient is $+1$ or $-1$. 
%   The zero in between may be represented as |o|.
%   
%   Once such a representation is given for individual terms, one may 
%   represent sums of terms simply by concatenating the 
%   representations of the terms, sorted by absolute value. The 
%   |-dictionary| comparison of two concatenations is then determined 
%   by the first position where they differ, i.e., by comparing the 
%   first two terms that are not identical, and the sums then compare 
%   as these terms do. For this to work when one sum is a prefix of 
%   another, it is however necessary to explictly put a ``zero'' term 
%   last.

% \begin{proc}{vertex_levels4,simplex}

%   
%   \begin{tcl}

%   The first part is to compute all negative multipliers, and among

%   The second part is to determine which shrink-edge will reach its

%   \end{tcl}
%   It is known that there is at least one shrink-edge, since the 
%   multiplier is negative.
%   
%   The third part is to remove the cut-edge from and add the 
%   shrink-edge to the working tree. This is by far the longest, 
%   since the relevant operations are not provided by any helper 
%   prodicedure. So, first remove the cut-edge from the 
%   \word{children} of its parent. A complication here is that the 
%   parent need not be the vertex at the parent end of the edge, but 
%   may be the root instead.
%   \begin{tcl}
      set p [lindex $NW 1 $cutedge [expr {1-$orient}]]

      }
      lset heap $p 2 $L
%   \end{tcl}
%   Next, add the shrink-edge to the tree. The orientation of this 
%   edge will be opposite to that of the cut-edge, since it 
%   vertically attaches to the other side of the brach; if the tail 
%   of the cut-edge was in the branch then it must be the head of the 
%   shrink-edge and vice versa, since one shrinks when the other 
%   grows.
%   \begin{tcl}
      set orient [expr {-$orient}]
      set p [lindex $NW 1 $shrinkedge [expr {1-$orient}]]

%   \end{tcl}
%   Finally flip all edges along the path from the new branch root to

%   modified and $q$ is the next node to modify---incidentally also 
%   the old parent of $p$, but afterwards it will be the other way 
%   round. The |shrinkedge| is what will become the parent edge of 
%   $p$.
%   \begin{tcl}

% 
% Before one can actually use this procedure to find the optimal 
% solution, it is however necessary to construct a valid initial 
% \word{heap}, which is not altogether trivial. The method used by 
% |vertex_levels4| is to put each vertex at its minimal position, 
% considering a vertex only when all its down-neighbours have already 
% been put in the tree.
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{vertex_levels4}
%   Providing yet another solution to the same problem, the 
%   |vertex_levels4| procedure computes a list assigning an integer 
%   level to each vertex, in such a way that the output end of an edge 
%   is always strictly less than the input end. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::vertex_levels4| \word{network}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is the list, indexed by vertex labels, of the 
%   assigned vertex levels.
%   
%   The lowest level is $0$, whose lone occupant is the output vertex 
%   |0|. Levels are always integers. The output vertex |0| always has 
%   a level less than any other vertex, and the input vertex |1| always 
%   has a level greater than any other vertex.
%   
%   The first step is to augment the \word{network} with extra 
%   edges for the non-edge inequalities.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::vertex_levels4 {NW} {

%   
%   Then comes the task of constructing the initial working tree. 
%   This is done with all vertices put in as low a $y$-position as 
%   possible, only attaching a vertex after all its down-neighbours 
%   have already been attached. This requires identifying the 
%   down-neighbour which puts the strictest bound on the vertex to 
%   attach, which amounts to finding the longest (when infinitesimal 
%   corrections are taken into account) path from the vertex to the 
%   root. Since all infinitesimal terms at this stage are negative, 
%   they can be kept as lists of orders, and it is necessary to keep 
%   track of all terms since the leading ones may well be common for 
%   several paths being compared. On the other hand, it is then not 
%   necessary to separately keep track of the finite part of the path 
%   length, since it is equal to the length of the list of orders. In 
%   the end, the longest path turns out to be the one whose list of

%   The above leaves vertex $1$ variable, but it has been claimed 
%   that this vertex should be fixed, so here's how to do that:

   lset heap 1 [list at [llength $Orders(1)] {}]
   lset heap $v 2 {}
%   \end{tcl}
%   Many more vertices may be fixed, to reduce the number of 
%   variables in the \textsc{simplex} phase, but the problem is how 
%   to do that. Fixing all vertices on the tree path from $1$ to $0$ 
%   may seem like the thing to do, but the problem is that this moves 
%   vertices infinitesimally upwards, which in turn may require other 
%   vertices to be reattached.
%   \begin{tcl}
%<timing>} 10]
%   \end{tcl}
%   Running \textsc{simplex} is delegated to a separate procedure 
%   (partly because this might eventually be shared with Yet Another 
%   |vertex_levels|$n$, should \(n=4\) prove too slow or something).
%   \begin{tcl}
%<timing>puts [time {
%<timing>   set heap2 [vertex_levels4,simplex $NW $heap]
%<timing>} 10]
%<-timing>   set heap [vertex_levels4,simplex $NW $heap]
%   \end{tcl}
%   Then there's the matter of constructing the result. This is done 
%   by changing all variable nodes in the tree to fixed nodes.
%   \begin{tcl}
%<timing>puts [time {
%<timing>   set heap $heap2
   set queue {}

% 
% \subsection{Sequencing of levels}
% 
% The following procedures seek to find a horizontal ordering of 
% vertices within each level.
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{level_observations}
%   For each level of a component, this procedure compiles a list of 
%   observations of that level, to serve as an aid for ordering the 
%   items in that level. An observation is in this case a list of 
%   items (on the |vertex |\word{label} or |edge |\word{label} form), 
%   listing items from left to right as they might be reached by 
%   different paths from some starting vertex. A weighted list of  
%   observations is a list with the structure
%   \begin{quote}
%     \begin{regblock}[\regstar]\word{observation} 
%     \word{weight}\end{regblock}
%   \end{quote}
%   where the \word{weight} is a real number. The return value is a 
%   list (one element for each level) of weighted lists of 
%   observations.
%   
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |level_observations| \word{network} \word{component} 
%     \word{ignore-list} \word{pseudo-outs} \word{pseudo-ins} 
%     \word{weight-base}\regopt
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{network} is the network to observe and 
%   \word{component} is the component (as a list of levels, where 
%   each level is a list of items) to observe within that network. 
%   Only |vertex| elements in the \word{component} are considered, 
%   but the \word{component} must include all neighbours of vertices 
%   in the \word{component}. |edge|s in the result are generated from 
%   the \word{network}, so there may occur even if they were not 
%   mentioned in the \word{component}.
%   
%   The \word{ignore-list} is a list of vertex labels. Observations 
%   made from these vertices will not be included in the result, but 
%   they may figure in observations. The \word{pseudo-outs} and 
%   \word{pseudo-ins} are lists of lists of edge labels. For each 
%   element of \word{pseduo-outs}, a sequence of observations are 
%   added as if these edges had been the output legs of the network 
%   (except that the listed edges themselves are not observed at any 
%   level, only the vertices at their input ends and up), and 
%   similarly for \word{pseudo-ins} but at the other end. (These 
%   features can be used to discover a good ordering of inputs and 
%   outputs in ambiguities.)
%   
%   The \word{weight-base} defaults to $0.9$. The weight attributed 
%   to an observation is the \word{weight-base} raised to the same 
%   power as the number of levels between the observer and that which 
%   is being observed.
%   
%   The first part of the procedure constructs observations looking 
%   down from a vertex. The idea is that one gets the observations 
%   from a vertex by concatenating the observations from its 
%   down-neighbours, so the processing proceeds from lower levels to 
%   higher levels. A slight complication is that a vertex in 
%   general observes several levels, so an entry of the |Downview| 
%   array is in general a list, where the $i$th element is the 
%   observation of level $i$. All levels are processed in turn for 
%   each vertex.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::level_observations {NW component ignoreL\
  pseudoOL pseudoIL {wb 0.9}} {
   set l -1; foreach level $component {incr l
      foreach item $level {
         if {[lindex $item 0] ne "vertex"} then {continue}
         set v [lindex $NW 0 [lindex $item 1]]
         for {set k 0} {$k<$l} {incr k} {
            set L {}
            foreach e [lindex $v 1] {
               set subitem [list vertex [lindex $NW 1 $e 0]]
               if {[llength $Downview($subitem)] <= $k} then {
                  lappend L [list edge $e]
%   \end{tcl}
%   If there are levels missing between that being generated and that 
%   which was available at a down-neighbour, then the intermediate 
%   levels should be padded out with the connecting edge.
%   \begin{tcl}
               } else {
                  eval [list lappend L]\
                    [lindex $Downview($subitem) $k]
               }
            }
            lappend Downview($item) $L
         }
%   \end{tcl}
%   The final step is in forming the observations from a vertex is to 
%   add the vertex itself, at the new level that it is in.
%   \begin{tcl}
         lappend Downview($item) [list $item]
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   The second part does the same thing for observations looking up.
%   \begin{tcl}
   for {set l 0} {$l < [llength $component]} {incr l} {
      foreach item [lindex $component end-$l] {
         if {[lindex $item 0] ne "vertex"} then {continue}
         set v [lindex $NW 0 [lindex $item 1]]
         for {set k 0} {$k<$l} {incr k} {
            set L {}
            foreach e [lindex $v 2] {
               set subitem [list vertex [lindex $NW 1 $e 2]]
               if {[llength $Upview($subitem)] <= $k} then {
                  lappend L [list edge $e]
               } else {
                  eval [list lappend L]\
                    [lindex $Upview($subitem) $k]
               }
            }
            lappend Upview($item) $L
         }
         lappend Upview($item) [list $item]
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   The third part constructs observations for the pseudo-inputs and 
%   pseudo-outputs; these are entered into the |Downview| and |Upview| 
%   arrays as elements with numeric names.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set item -1; foreach inL $pseudoIL {incr item
      set k -1; foreach level $component {incr k
         set L {}
         foreach e $inL {
            set subitem [list vertex [lindex $NW 1 $e 0]]
            if {[llength $Downview($subitem)] > $k} then {
               eval [list lappend L] [lindex $Downview($subitem) $k]
            }
         }
         lappend Downview($item) $L
      }
   }
   set item -1; foreach outL $pseudoOL {incr item
      set k -1; foreach level $component {incr k
         set L {}
         foreach e $inL {
            set subitem [list vertex [lindex $NW 1 $e 2]]
            if {[llength $Upview($subitem)] > $k} then {
               eval [list lappend L] [lindex $Upview($subitem) $k]
            }
         }
         lappend Upview($item) $L
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   The last part is to construct the return value. If the current 
%   level is below the level of an item, then the observation should 
%   be taken from looking down, otherwise the observation is taken 
%   from looking up. Observations of less than two items in a level 
%   are ignored, as they do not contribute any new information. First 
%   the observations from ignored vertices are removed, however.
%   \begin{tcl}
   foreach v $ignoreL {
      unset -nocomplain Downview([list vertex $v])\
        Upview([list vertex $v])
   }
   set we [expr {log($wb)}]
   set res {}
   set l -1; set k [llength $component]
   foreach level $component {
      incr l; incr k -1
      set L {}
      foreach item [array names Downview] {
         set len [llength $Downview($item)]
         set w [expr {exp((abs($len-1-$l)-1)*$we)}]
         if {$l < $len} then {
            if {[llength [lindex $Downview($item) $l]]>1} then {
               lappend L [lindex $Downview($item) $l] $w
            }
         } else {
            if {[llength [lindex $Upview($item) $k]]>1} then {
               lappend L [lindex $Upview($item) $k] $w
            }
         }
      }
      lappend res $L
   }
   return $res
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% \subsubsection{Sequencing by extending orders}
% 
% The idea of the next procedure is that an extraction of an order from 
% a digraph one should begin by looking for a maximal path 
% in the digraph that one wishes to sequence, as that can then be taken 
% as a chain in the output sequence of all items. If the path happens 
% to be hamiltonian, we're even done.
% 
% Paths should be compared as follows:
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item
%     By length (longer is better), since using all vertices in a cycle 
%     is better than stopping one short to avoid seeing the back-edge.
%   \item
%     By number of back-edges (fewer is better). This has the effect of 
%     cutting a cycle at its thinnest part.
%   \item
%     By length of the back-edges (shorter is better), lexicographically.
% \end{enumerate}
% It would be fairly easy (although asymptotically rather slow) to 
% compile a list of all paths in a digraph and then sort it to find the 
% best path, but how does one proceed from there? Possibly by discarding 
% those paths that contradict the chosen order and then trying 
% again\Ldash it could even be considered part of one big loop, where 
% paths are incorporated into the sequence as they are found\Dash but 
% how does one integrate paths into a total order? Answer: By putting 
% them into a partial order first! 
% 
% This looks like it could be \emph{real} slow. But let's try it anyway!
% 
% \begin{proc}{order_using_paths}
%   This procedure tries to extract a natural total order for a list 
%   \word{items} of items from a list \word{observations} of 
%   observations of said elements, as described above. The call syntax 
%   is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::order_using_paths| 
%     \begin{regblock}[\regopt]|-limit| \word{limit}\end{regblock}
%     \word{items} \word{observations}
%   \end{quote}
%   where the \word{limit} can be used to bail out if it seems the 
%   full ordering will be too expensive: if there are more paths in 
%   total than the \word{limit} value then the procedure just returns 
%   an empty list. Otherwise the return value is the reordered list 
%   of items. The default \word{limit} is $325$ (the number of paths 
%   in a $K_5$).
%   \changes{2}{2007/02/27}{\texttt{-limit} option added. (LH)}
%   
%   \changes{2}{2007/02/27}{Now using weighted comparisons. (LH)}
%   \textbf{Note} that the \word{observations} here is a list
%   \begin{quote}
%     \begin{regblock}[\regstar]\word{observation} 
%     \word{weight}\end{regblock}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{weight} is a real number that is a weight to attach 
%   to the preceeding \word{observation}. This weight is taken into 
%   account when comparing the number of back-edges, so that the 
%   multiplicity comparison really is done in two steps:
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item[2a]
%       By total weight of back-edges (arithmetic sum), where less 
%       weight is better.
%     \item[2b]
%       By total number of back-edges, where fewer is better.
%   \end{enumerate}
%   The 2b step is necessary for the correctness of the comparison 
%   step on length of back-edges.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::order_using_paths {args} {
   if {[llength $args] < 2} then {
      return -code error "Wrong # of arguments"
   }
   set itemL [lindex $args end-1]
   set obsL [lindex $args end]
   array set Opt {-limit 325}
   array set Opt [lrange $args 0 end-2]
   if {[llength $itemL] <= 1} then {return $itemL}
%   \end{tcl}
%   The first step is to combine the \word{observations} into a 
%   digraph with multiplicity. |D| is a list, with the same indices as 
%   |itemL|, and its elements are lists
%   \begin{quote}
%     \begin{regblock}[\regstar]\word{vertex-label} 
%     \word{multiplicity} \word{weight-sum}\end{regblock}
%   \end{quote}
%   where each \word{vertex-label} is the out-neighbour at the other 
%   end and \word{multiplicity} is the number of edges from this 
%   vertex to that vertex. |E| is a temporary array with indices on 
%   the form \meta{from-label}\verb*" "\meta{to-label} and whose 
%   entries are lists with one weight for every edge. |E2| is another 
%   temporary array which is cleared for each observation. The 
%   indices are on the same form as in |E| whereas the entries are 
%   string with one character for every pair in the observation. Only 
%   pairs that occur more often than opposite pairs make it into |E|.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set n -1; foreach item $itemL {incr n
      set itemNum($item) $n
   }
   foreach {obs weight} $obsL {
      set n 0; foreach item $obs {incr n
         if {![info exists itemNum($item)]} then {continue}
         set i $itemNum($item)
         foreach item [lrange $obs $n end] {
            if {[info exists itemNum($item)]} then {
               append "E2($i $itemNum($item))" .
            }
         }
      }
      foreach pair [array names E2] {
         set oppair [list [lindex $pair 1] [lindex $pair 0]]
         if {![info exists E2($oppair)] ||\
           [string length $E2($pair)] > [string length $E2($oppair)]}\
         then {lappend E($pair) $weight}
      }
      array unset E2
   }
   set D {}
   foreach item $itemL {
      set L {}
      foreach pair [array names E "[llength $D] *"] {
         set weight 0.0
         foreach w $E($pair) {set weight [expr {$weight+$w}]}
         lappend L [lindex $pair 1] [llength $E($pair)] $weight
      }
      lappend D $L
   }
   array unset E
%   \end{tcl}
%   A variation that could be made here would be to exclude loops in 
%   the digraph. The effect of including the loops is that vertices 
%   with a lot of loops (which should indicate ambiguity in its 
%   position) are avoided, in the sense that it counts as a 
%   disadvantage for paths to pass them. I expect the effect to be 
%   rather small, however.
%   
%   The second part is the dreaded construction of a list of all 
%   paths. It is a DFS using a |stack|, where the elements are lists 
%   on the form
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{vertex-list} \word{backedge-lengths} \word{back-weight}
%   \end{quote}
%   The \word{vertex-list} is the list of vertices in the path, in 
%   order from first to last. The \word{backedge-lengths} is the list 
%   (in no particular order) of lengths of backedges in the path, 
%   \emph{not including backedges from the last vertex}. The 
%   \word{back-weight} is the sum of the weights of the edges which 
%   have contributed to the \word{backedge-lengths} list.
%   
%   What is produced by this work is a list of paths |pathL|, whose 
%   elements are lists with the structure
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{vertex-list} \word{comparison-list}
%   \end{quote}
%   The \word{vertex-list} is the actual path, as in the |stack|. The 
%   \word{comparison-list} is the thing according to which different 
%   paths should be compared. It is a list with the structure
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{\# vertices left} \word{backedge-weight} 
%     \word{\# backedges} \word{backedge-length}\regstar
%   \end{quote}
%   and will be treated as described above by |lsort -dictionary|. 
%   The \word{backedge-weight} is given with six decimals to ensure 
%   this comparison will give it a sensible interpretation. 
%   (A possible variation could be to use the number of edges in the 
%   path instead of the number of vertices, i.e., to give a bonus to 
%   paths containing multiple edges. I can't see that this change 
%   would be to the better, however.)
%   
%   The stack is initialised with one element for each vertex (the 
%   length $0$ paths). The partial order |P| to construct in the 
%   third part is also initialised with the identity relation.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set stack {}
   foreach item $itemL {
      set "P([llength $stack] [llength $stack])" {}
      lappend stack [list [list [llength $stack]] {} 0.0]
   }
   set pathL {}
   while {[llength $stack]} {
      foreach {path backlenL weight} [lindex $stack end] break
      set stack [lreplace $stack [set stack end] end]
      set L {}
      foreach {v mult w} [lindex $D [lindex $path end]] {
         set n [lsearch -exact -integer $path $v]
         if {$n>=0} then {
            set n [expr {[llength $path] - $n - 1}]
            for {} {$mult>0} {incr mult -1} {lappend backlenL $n}
            set weight [expr {$weight+$w}]
         } else {
            lappend L $v
         }
      }
      lappend pathL [list $path [
         linsert [lsort -integer -decreasing $backlenL] 0\
           [expr {[llength $itemL]-[llength $path]}]\
           [format %f.6 $weight] [llength $backlenL]
      ]]
      if {[llength $pathL] > $Opt(-limit)} then {return}
      foreach v $L {
         lappend stack [list [linsert $path end $v] $backlenL $weight]
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   
%   The third part is to construct a partial order |P|, by adding to 
%   it all chains implied by the paths that do not contradict the |P| 
%   so far constructed. The |target| is the size |P| would have if it 
%   is a total order on the items; if this is reached then the rest 
%   of the |pathL| can be skipped.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set target [expr {[llength $itemL] * ([llength $itemL]+1) / 2}]
   foreach pair [
      lsort -index 1 -dictionary $pathL
   ] {

%   The fourth and final part turns the partial order |P| into a 
%   permutation of |itemL|. |P| need not be a total ordering at this 
%   point, but since all observations turn up as paths of length $1$, 
%   any two items that have been compared will be related by |P| at 
%   this stage.
%   
%   The method used to extract a total order from the partial order 
%   |P| is to order items by the sizes of their down-sets.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set L {}
   foreach item $itemL {
      lappend L [list $item [llength [array names P "* [llength $L]"]]]

% Interestingly enough, |order_using_paths| turns out to do exactly 
% the right thing for all ``difficult'' cases that had previously 
% been constructed for other ordering procedures below. Nor does it 
% seems to be unacceptably slow (even though it is superexponential 
% in both time and memory for complete digraphs), so it should 
% probably be the default choice for ordering by observations.
% 
% \begin{proc}{order_path_Kn}
%   Well, aymptotics that have no impact during development often 
%   surfaces with a vengence once one enters the ``production'' 
%   phase. Hence it may be a good idea to find out how long it takes 
%   before the superexponential behaviour gets noticable; there's a 
%   difference between it becoming dominant for $5$ elements or for 
%   $10$ elements.
%   
%   The following procedure generates observations for a complete 
%   digraph on $n$ vertices. This is useful for |time|ing 
%   |order_using_paths|.
%   \begin{tcl}
%<*test2>
proc network::pure::order_path_Kn {n} {
   set obsL {}
   set itemL {}
   for {set i 0} {$i<$n} {incr i} {

      for {set j 0} {$j<$n} {incr j} {
         lappend obsL [list $i $j] 1.0
      }
   }
   order_using_paths $itemL $obsL
}
%</test2>
%   \end{tcl}
%   Timing experiments show that the execution time is starting to 
%   get annoying already for \(n=5\), and the superexponential 
%   behaviour is quite noticable.
% \end{proc}
% 
% \begin{proc}{sequence_from_digraph}
%   The |sequence_from_digraph| procedure tries to find an ordering 
%   of the vertices of a multidigraph (given as a weighted adjancecy 
%   matrix) so that the edges mostly go from right to left. The 
%   algorithm used is at best a heuristic, and unfortunately it seems 
%   to have a tendency to get it wrong.
%   
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |sequence_from_digraph| \word{matrix}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is a permutation of $\{0,1,\dotsc, n 
%   -\nobreak 1\}$, where \word{matrix} is an $n \times n$ matrix. 
%   The elements of this matrix are numbers (which may be real 
%   and\slash negative, even though natural numbers probably makes 
%   most sense) and the element |lindex |\word{matrix}| $i $j| is 
%   interpreted as the multiplicity (or more generally weight) of the 
%   edge from $j$ to $i$.
%   
%   The algorithm idea is to remove vertices one by one until only 
%   none remain, and then reinsert the vertices one by one in the 
%   position which minimises the number of edges going backwards. 
%   During the vertex removal phase, the weights of edges in the 
%   remaining graph are increased by the number of equivalent paths 
%   passing through the removed vertex, to compensate for the removal 
%   of this vertex. The principles used are that two edges in series 
%   count as the minimum of their weights, while two edges in 
%   parallel count as the sum of their weights. The first principle 
%   has the effect that the strength of a cycle (minimum of the 
%   weights of edges on it\Dash think wakest link of a chain) is 
%   preserved during vertex removal, whereas the second principle 
%   says that parallel paths can support each other. It may seem as 
%   though this is somehow counting edge-disjoint paths from one 
%   vertex to another, but for that the algorithm is imperfect. 
%   Consider the matrix
%   \[
%     \begin{pmatrix}
%       0& 0& 0& 0\\
%       1& 0& 0& 0\\
%       1& 1& 0& 0\\
%       0& 1& 2& 0
%     \end{pmatrix}
%   \]
%   Removing first vertex $1$ and then vertex $2$ will produce 
%   matrices as on the left, whereas removing first vertex $2$ and 
%   then vertex $1$ will produce matrices as on the right:
%   \begin{align*}
%     \begin{pmatrix}
%       0& \cdot& 0& 0\\
%       \cdot& \cdot& \cdot& \cdot\\
%       2& \cdot& 0& 0\\
%       1& \cdot& 2& 0
%     \end{pmatrix} &&&
%     \begin{pmatrix}
%       0& 0& \cdot& 0\\
%       1& 0& \cdot& 0\\
%       \cdot& \cdot& \cdot& \cdot\\
%       1& 2& \cdot& 0
%     \end{pmatrix}
%     \\
%     \begin{pmatrix}
%       0& \cdot& \cdot& 0\\
%       \cdot& \cdot& \cdot& \cdot\\
%       \cdot& \cdot& \cdot& \cdot\\
%       3& \cdot& \cdot& 0
%     \end{pmatrix} &&&
%     \begin{pmatrix}
%       0& \cdot& \cdot& 0\\
%       \cdot& \cdot& \cdot& \cdot\\
%       \cdot& \cdot& \cdot& \cdot\\
%       2& \cdot& \cdot& 0
%     \end{pmatrix}
%   \end{align*}
%   The problem is that the path from $0$ to $2$ via $1$ is counted 
%   as independent of the path from $0$ to $3$ via $1$, which isn't 
%   the case as they both use the same weight $1$ path from $0$ to 
%   $1$. In order to properly count edge-disjoint paths, one would 
%   have to interpret the digraph as a network compute a maximal flow 
%   from one vertex to the other, but it is not clear that this would 
%   necessarily give a better take on the vertex ordering problem 
%   targeted here.
%   
%   In the first algorithmic step, 
%   the vertices are removed in decreasing order, and the weights in 
%   the reduced adjacency matrix are modified as explained above.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::sequence_from_digraph {A} {
   for {set n [llength $A]; incr n -1} {$n>0} {incr n -1} {
      for {set i 0} {$i < $n} {incr i} {
         set w2 [lindex $A $i $n]
         for {set j 0} {$j < $n} {incr j} {
            set w0 [lindex $A $i $j]
            set w1 [lindex $A $n $j]
            lset A $i $j [expr {$w1<$w2 ? $w0+$w1 : $w0+$w2}]
         }
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   In the second algorithmic step, the vertices are reinserted in 
%   the opposite order. The |i| variable holds the insertion position 
%   currently being considered. The |sum| variable is the sum of all 
%   weights of backedges (incident with the vertex to insert) if the 
%   vertex is inserted at position |i|. 
%   \begin{tcl}
   set res {}
   for {set n 0} {$n < [llength $A]} {incr n} {
      set sum 0
      foreach u $res {
         set sum [expr {$sum + [lindex $A $u $n]}]
      }
      set best $sum
      set where 0
      set i 0; foreach u $res {incr i
         set sum [expr {$sum - [lindex $A $u $n] + [lindex $A $n $u]}]
         if {$sum <= $best} then {
            set best $sum ; set where $i
         }
      }
      set res [linsert $res $where $n]
   }
   return $res
}
%   \end{tcl}
%   The experiment |network::pure::sequence_from_digraph\
%   {{0 0 0 1} {1 0 0 0} {1 1 0 0} {0 1 2 0}}| (which returns 
%   |0 3 2 1| rather than the expected |3 2 1 0|) indicates that this 
%   is perhaps not as good an algorithm as it initially seemed. Need 
%   to rethink the matter.

% \subsubsection{Ranking by score}
% 
% Ranking is the problem of totally ordering a list of items given 
% some information about how they compare (when no additional 
% comparisons can be obtained). A very common idea for this is to 
% assign a score to each item and then consider the items to compare 
% as their scores. One might imagine that the world of chess should 
% have solved to problem of how to compute good scores for players 
% (since they actually have such a ranking system in operation), but 
% unfortunately the chess ranking is a rather strange system with 
% substantial flaws in its theoretical basis, so we will have to look 
% elsewhere for something usable.
% 
% \begin{proc}{colley_ranking}
%   The Colley ranking~\cite{Colley} is a method (originally deviced 
%   for American college football championships) of ranking a set of 
%   ``teams'' based on the set of matches they have played, even if the 
%   opponents in those matches do not cover a representative subset of 
%   the league as a whole. The idea is that the relative strengths (as 
%   computed by the ranking method itself) of the opponents should be 
%   taken into account when judging what a particular combination of 
%   wins or losses means to the ranking. Practically one ends up 
%   solving a linear equation system.
%   
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |colley_ranking| \word{teams} \word{observations} 
%     \word{pre-season}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{teams} is the number $n$ of teams (called $0$, $1$, 
%   dots, $n-1$) to rank and \word{observations} is the list of 
%   observations according to which they should be ranked. An 
%   observation is a list of team names, where a pair $(i,j)$ means 
%   `$i$ lost to $j$', a triple $(i,j,k)$ means `$i$ lost to $j$ and 
%   $k$, and $j$ lost to $k$', etc. Teams can occur more than once in 
%   an observation, and in that case subobservations of the form 
%   `$i$ lost to $i$' should be ignored.
%   
%   The \word{pre-season} argument is a special feature to force 
%   breaking ties in a way that does not contradict too many 
%   observation. What it means is that the first \word{pre-season} 
%   matches that can be parsed out of the \word{observations} should 
%   be ignored when ranking; hopefully this will disturb an 
%   equilibrium enough to allow some team to be split away from the 
%   other. \word{pre-season} must be an integer, and the feature is 
%   inactive for non-positive values.
%   
%   The return value is the ranking vector. However, if 
%   \word{pre-season} is greater than or equal to the number of 
%   matches observed then the procedure will return with a |break| 
%   code, to force exit of a surrounding loop.
%   
%   The algorithm is to solve the equation \(C \mathbf{x} = 
%   \mathbf{b}\), where $C$ is the so-called Colley matrix for the 
%   problem. This is defined by
%   \begin{equation*}
%     C_{ij} = \begin{cases}
%       2 + \#(\text{games played by team $i$})& \text{if \(i=j\),}\\
%       -\#(\text{games $i$ against $j$})& \text{otherwise.}
%     \end{cases}
%   \end{equation*}
%   The vector $\mathbf{b}$ has $b_i$ equal to $1$ plus half the 
%   difference between the number of wins for team $i$ and the number 
%   of losses for team $i$. It may be observed that this does not 
%   take into account \emph{against which} teams there were losses or 
%   wins, which may seem a bit surprising, but if the results agree 
%   with a partial ordering of the teams then this partial ordering 
%   can actually be recovered from $C$ and $\mathbf{b}$.
%   
%   The implementation first constructs the augmented matrix for the 
%   equation system, then uses Gaussian elimination and 
%   back-substitution to solve it.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::colley_ranking {teams obsL preseason} {
%   \end{tcl}
%   The augmented matrix is first filled in with the data 
%   corresponding to ``no matches played'', so that its entries can 
%   subsequently be freely accessed with |lindex| and |lset|. Note 
%   that all entries are doubles,
%   \begin{tcl}
   set L [string repeat "0.0 " $teams]
   lappend L 1.0
   set Cb {}
   for {set i 0} {$i<$teams} {incr i} {
      lappend Cb $L
      lset Cb $i $i 2.0
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Then augmented matrix is updated with the observations.
%   \begin{tcl}
   foreach obs $obsL {
      for {set n 1} {$n < [llength $obs]} {incr n} {
         set j [lindex $obs $n]
         for {set m 0} {$m<$n} {incr m} {
            set i [lindex $obs $m]
            if {$i == $j} then {continue}
            if {[incr preseason -1] >= 0} then {continue}
            lset Cb $i $i [expr {[lindex $Cb $i $i] + 1}]
            lset Cb $i $j [expr {[lindex $Cb $i $j] - 1}]
            lset Cb $j $i [expr {[lindex $Cb $j $i] - 1}]
            lset Cb $j $j [expr {[lindex $Cb $j $j] + 1}]
            lset Cb $i end [expr {[lindex $Cb $i end] - 0.5}]
            lset Cb $j end [expr {[lindex $Cb $j end] + 0.5}]
         }
      }
   }
   if {$preseason>=0} then {return -code break}
%   \end{tcl}
%   If no observations have been registered, then |break| the caller, 
%   as specified.
%   
%   Next step is the Gaussian elimination. It can be carried 
%   out without having to worry about pivoting elements, 
%   thanks to the particular structure of the Colley matrix $C$. 
%   Proof: The matrix starts out with each row having a sum of 
%   $2$ and all off-diagonal elements non-positive (hence all 
%   diagonal elements $\geqslant 2$). After each step 
%   of the elimination, it remains true for the submatrix left to 
%   eliminate that the the row sums are at least $2$ and all 
%   off-diagonal elements are non-positive, because all row multiples 
%   being added are non-negative and hence the only thing ever added 
%   to an off-diagonal element is a non-positive number. At the same 
%   time, the row sums never decrease.
%   
%   For practical reasons, it is more convenient to eliminate 
%   right-to-left, so the result after the elimination step will be a 
%   lower triangular system rather than the traditional upper 
%   triangular system.
%   \begin{tcl}
   for {set n [llength $Cb]; incr n -1} {$n>=0} {incr n -1} {
      for {set i [expr {$n-1}]} {$i>=0} {incr i -1} {
         set mult [expr {-[lindex $Cb $i $n]/[lindex $Cb $n $n]}]
         set L {}
         foreach x [lindex $Cb $i] y [lindex $Cb $n] {
            lappend L [expr {$x + $mult*$y}]
         }
         lset Cb $i $L
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Finally, there is the back-substitution step. Since the matrix is 
%   now lower triangular, the result vector can be constructed start 
%   to end.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set res {}
   foreach row $Cb {
      set sum [lindex $row end]
      set j 0
      foreach x $res {
         set sum [expr {$sum - [lindex $row $j]*$x}]
         incr j
      }
      lappend res [expr {$sum / [lindex $row $j]}]
   }
   return $res
}
%   \end{tcl}
%   
%   In the example
%   \begin{quote}
%     |colley_ranking 4 {{0 1 2} {2 3} {1 3} {3 0}} 0|
%   \end{quote}
%   teams |0| and |1| both get the ranking $\frac{5}{12}$, whereas 
%   teams |2| and |3| both get the ranking $\frac{7}{12}$. This is no 
%   accident; all teams play each other team once, and the first two 
%   have one win and two defeats (whereas the last two have two wins 
%   and one defeat), so of course they will get the same ranking by 
%   this method. Computing rankings within the subproblems of only 
%   teams |0| and |1|, or only teams |2| and |3|, would however 
%   distinguish these, so that one gets the order |0<1<2<3|.
%   
%   This will however not work with cycles, as the Colley ranking is 
%   insensitive to reversals of cycles (each team still plays the 
%   exact same set of teams, and it still has the same number of wins 
%   and defeats). Setting \word{pre-season} to |1| will in that case 
%   remove some edge from the cycle, and the rest of it will be 
%   ordered as expected.
%   
%   A case that probably isn't unusual in practice is however that 
%   there simply aren't any (useful) observations. Raising the 
%   \word{pre-season} limit won't do any good in that case, so a 
%   caller that tries to do so should probably take a |break|.
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{rank_by_observations}
%   This procedure takes a list of items (arbitrary strings) and a list 
%   of ``observations'' of relative orderings of those items. It 
%   returns an ordering of the items which is mostly (as much as 
%   possible) consistent with the given observations.
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     \raggedright
%     |rank_by_observations| \word{rank-procedure}\regopt
%     \ \word{item-list} \word{observation-list}

%   where an observation is a list of strings. Some elements are 
%   expected to be among the given items, and elements that are not are 
%   ignored. The \word{rank-procedure} is a command prefix.
%   
%   The algorithm is based on using the \word{rank-procedure} to 
%   rank the items. This defaults to |colley_ranking|, and a custom

%   If several items get the same rank, then a recursive call is used

% insert a \emph{charged} capacitor between two nodes for every 
% comparison. There will be a lot of short-curcuiting going on, but 
% the equilibrium voltages after the entire curcuit has been 
% assembled could be used to rank the nodes. The main problem is how 
% to compute these equilibrium voltages: series- and 
% parallel-reduction theorems exist for capacitors (and can be 
% extended suitably to the current situation), but these do not 
% suffice for analysing arbitrary curcuits. 
% Delta--star-transformations probably exist, but would have to be 
% derived, and they won't suffice for graphs with girth greater than 
% $3$.
% 
% Awkwardly enough, it feels as if there is some set of variables for 
% which the equilibrium would be rather easy to compute, but I can't 
% guess which they are at the moment. [Sigh!]
% 
% An advantage of the capacitor heuristic compared to the the Colley 
% ranking is that it handles the situation of a cycle with one leaf 
% attached by giving all vertices in the cycle the same voltage, 
% whereas Colley gives them unequal ranks, putting the vertex of 
% attachment at the extreme \emph{opposite} to the leaf (which is the 
% opposite of what one would want).
% 
% 
% 
% \paragraph{Full network ordering}
% 
% An alternative to ordering the levels of the network might seem to be 
% to order the entire network in a single step. An advantage of this 
% should be that it might be better at making the levels consistent 
% with each other, but all ranking algorithms deviced so far all fail 
% to produce the expected results for trees; it's very easy that 
% branches become entwined a couple of levels from the root if one 
% only considers local properties. Another disadvantage is that edges 
% loose their natural place in the ordering process.
% 
% An approach which looks promising is to keep the grading of the 
% network, but sequence the levels in parallel. This means the main 
% data structure for a level will be a partial order, which starts 
% out as an antichain. In each step of the process, each level 
% contributes observations of neighbouring levels, based on 
% tail\slash head indices or new orderings within the partial order. 
% The total of all observations of a level (that do not contradict 
% what is already in the partial order) is then judged and new 
% relations are added to the partial order. When no new relations are 
% discovered, the partial orders are linearised as in 
% |order_using_paths| and the full component order can be returned.
% 
% An advantage of this idea is that it avoids a combinatorial 
% explosion in |list_path_observations| that occurs because that 
% procedure effectively expands the input DAG into a tree; if 
% observations are only between neighbouring levels, the total number 
% of observations will be polynomially bounded.
% 
% The tricky issue is how to judge a set of observations. The longest 
% path algorithm of |order_using_observations| is one possibility, 
% but that is superexponential also in this case, so it should be 
% avoided if possible. An advantage of the partial ordering situation 
% is that the judge doesn't have to make a full decision and can 
% instead just rule on an obvious issue and hope that more evidence 
% can help resolve also the rest.
% 
% One interesting possibility is that of a ``$x$ near $y$'' ruling, 
% which could come about if many observations say \(x < y\) and an 
% equal number of observations say \(x > y\). The way this could be 
% realised is that if $x$ and $y$ are ruled as near then they will 
% get the same up- and downsets. However, such rulings go beyond 
% partial orders into the realm of total quasi-orders, and may 
% therefore be inappropriate.
% 
% \begin{algsketch}[Judging]
%   Read all observations, discarding those that directly contradict 
%   the current partial order $P$, and form the reflexive-transitive 
%   hull $Q$ of the these and the current partial order. $Q$ is then 
%   a quasi-order. Add all strict inequalities from $Q$ to $P$, as 
%   they are undisputed.
% \end{algsketch}
%   
% If this really added anything then we're happy, but what if it 
% didn't? Observations don't go away, so the $Q$-equivalence 
% classes can never shrink. Moreover, it can happen that 
% \(x < y \pin{P}\) and \(y \leqslant z \leqslant x \pin{Q}\), 
% which means $Q$-equivalence need not respect $P$-inequalities. 
% Apparently $z$ should be near $x$ or $y$, but it may not be 
% between $x$ and $y$.
% 
% The sensible response to this predicament is probably to fall back 
% on some kind of numerical algorithm for ordering the equivalence 
% classes. It should be observed that doing so will \emph{not} reduce 
% the number of observations of neighbouring levels, as only 
% inequalities in $P$ may generate observations.
% 
% Another point that should be observed is that the existence of $z$ 
% such that \(y \leqslant z \leqslant x \pin{Q}\) where already 
% \(x < y \pin{P}\) should not prevent adding \(x < w < y \pin{P}\) 
% if the only things known about $w$ is its relations to $x$ and $y$. 
% This may seem straightforward, but remember that $P$ does not give 
% any special power to $x$ or $y$\Dash it can only say something 
% about the relation between them.
% 
% 
% 
% 
% \paragraph{Planarity and embeddings}
% 
% Networks have a built-in combinatorial embedding determined by the 
% head and tail indices, which means it is easy to test whether a 
% given network is plane. Since the indices of inputs and outputs are 
% fairly arbitrary, it is also of interest to find an assignment of 
% these that will make the network as near-plane as possible; hopefully 
% this will simplify drawing and presenting the network later on.
% 
% The main tool for exploring embedding issues is the \emph{Euler 
% characteristic}
% \begin{equation*}
%   \#\text{vertices} - \#\text{edges} + \#\text{facets}
% \end{equation*}
% which is $2$ for a plane embedding, and generally $2-2g$ for an 
% embedding into an orientable surface of genus $g$. With respect to 
% non-orientable surfaces, the Euler characteristic is $2$ minus the 
% number of crosscaps one has to put into the surface in order to make 
% the embedding work. The Euler characteristic can thus serve as a 
% measure of how near planarity an embedding is, and since the numbers 
% of vertices and edges respecitively are fixed, the problems boil down 
% to maximising the number of facets. The input and output vertices 
% should be identified (which in many cases is equivalent to connecting 
% them by an extra edge) for purposes of examining this issue.
% 
% When seeking a near-plane embedding, there are two kinds of freedom. 
% The first is the assignment of input and output indices to legs, 
% which is what gives the wanted answer. The other is the assignment of 
% signs to edges, where a negative sign signifies that the edge in 
% question is passing through a crosscap (which twists the edge by half 
% a turn, thus switching the sides). Negative signs are only needed for 
% embedding into non-orientable surfaces, but the example of
% \begin{equation*}
%   a = (m \otimes m) \circ (2\:3) \circ (\Delta \otimes \Delta)
% \end{equation*}
% (one crossing) versus
% \begin{equation*}
%   (1\:2) \circ a \circ (1\:2) = 
%   (m \otimes m) \circ (1\:4) \circ (\Delta \otimes \Delta)
% \end{equation*}
% (five crossings) suggest that non-orientable embeddings should be 
% considered; the simplest orientable surface where both embed is the 
% torus, but $a$ can also be embedded into the projective 
% plane.\footnote{$(1\:2) \circ a \circ (1\:2)$ also has such an 
% embedding, if one connects input and output by an edge rather than 
% identifying them, and accepts giving this edge a negative sign! Doing 
% so does however preserve the idea that the input\&output vertex 
% should be considered the vertex containing the unbounded part of the 
% canvas.}
% 
% 
% \subsubsection{Best practices}
% 
% The best solution found so far seems to be to first try 
% |order_using_paths|, but switch to |rank_by_observations| if the 
% former bails out. It is convenient to have an ordering procedure 
% which implements precisely that.
% 
% \begin{proc}{default_observation_order}
%   This procedure has the call syntax
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::pure::default_observation_order| 
%     \word{item-list} \word{observations}
%   \end{quote}
%   and returns the \word{item-list} reordered to fit with the given 
%   \word{observations}.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::default_observation_order {itemL obsL} {
   set L [order_using_paths $itemL $obsL]
   if {[llength $L]} then {return $L}
   return [rank_by_observations $itemL $obsL]
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% Is this anything to worry about, though? Sadly, it is. Even in a 
% plane network, it is easy to end up with a situation where every 
% item is observed to the left of every other item, because some 
% vertex observing all of them is itself observed in two different 
% positions by another vertex.
% 
% 
% 
% \subsection{Network components}
% 
% \begin{proc}{components}
%   The |components| procedure breaks a network down into component 
%   pieces. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |components| \word{network}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is the list of component pieces. The first 
%   piece is always the component containing the output and input 
%   vertices (even if it is not connected), but the order of other 
%   components is arbitrary (depends on the vertex labelling).
%   
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::components {NW} {
   set res {}
   set current {}
   for {set n 0} {$n<[llength [lindex $NW 0]]} {incr n} {

%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% \begin{proc}{component}
%   The |component| procedure enumerates the vertices and edges in 
%   \emph{one} component of (or a union of components in) a network. 
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |component| \word{network} \word{vertices} \word{edges}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{vertices} and \word{edges} are lists of labels. The 
%   return value is a pair of lists
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{vertices} \word{edges}
%   \end{quote}
%   which contain the labels of all vertices and edges respectively 
%   that are in the same component as one given in the argument 
%   \word{vertices} or \word{edges}.

% 
% \begin{proc}{graded_components}
%   This procedure breaks a network down into components and each 
%   component down into levels, but the elements within a level are 
%   not ordered. The return value is thus a list of components, where 
%   a component is a list (indexed by level number) of levels, and a 
%   level is a list of elements of the forms
%   \begin{quote}
%     |vertex| \word{vertex-label}\\
%     |edge| \word{edge-label}
%   \end{quote}
%   |edge| elements occur for edges between two nonadjacent levels, 
%   and the same |edge| element may occur in several levels. 
%   The first component always contains the input and output 
%   vertices, but the order of other components is unspecified.
%   
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |graded_components| \word{network} \word{level-list}\regopt
%     \ \word{component-list}\regopt
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{network} is the network to break down into levels. 
%   The \word{level-list} is a list indexed by vertex label 
%   specifying the levels (nonnegative integers) for the vertices. If 
%   this is not specified, then the procedure will call 
%   |vertex_levels3| to compute it. The \word{component-list} is the 
%   list of components to grade, where a component is a network piece 
%   including both edges and vertices. If this is not specified, then 
%   the procedure will call |components| to compute it.
%   
%   The algorithm idea is: first put the vertices in the proper 
%   levels, then fill in with edges where necesssary.

% 
% \begin{proc}{order_graded_components}
%   This procedure orders the elements of each level in a list of 
%   graded components so that they optimally fit with possible 
%   observations of order from within the network. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |order_graded_components| \begin{regblock}[\regstar]\word{option} 
%     \word{value}\end{regblock} \word{network} \word{component-list}

%   and the return value is the reordered \word{component}. The 
%   \word{component} is a list of pieces, corresponding to levels in 
%   the network, where the first one is closest to the output and the 
%   last closest to the input.
%   
%   The supported \word{option} is
%   \begin{ttdescription}
%     \item[-seqcmd]
%       This option selects the method to use for combining the

% \subsection{Whole component sequencing}
% \label{Ssec:UtvidgaPartialording}
% 
% In order to overcome the complexity problems that the sequencing 
% from observations suffers from, a whole-component algorithm is in 
% order. The basic idea for this algorithm is that information about 
% what is to the left or right of something else is propagated from 
% each level to the levels above and below, where it is used to 
% extend the current partial order on that level. Observations are 
% inherently local, and it is only when combined with an established 
% order within a level that it extends over a distance.
% 
% The basic data structure for a level is the established partial 
% order on its elements. This starts out as the equality relation and 
% is never reduced, only extended, while being kept transitive-closed 
% and antisymmetric. The first (perhaps overly simplistic) 
% implementation of this idea maintains antisymmetry simply by adding 
% relations (pairs) one by one and rejecting those that are not 
% consistent with the partial order obtained after adding the 
% previous one\Dash this means cycle cutting becomes a bit arbitrary, 
% but probably not disturbingly so.
% 
% \begin{proc}{extend_partial_order}
%   This procedure is a helper that updates a partial order to the 
%   transitive closure of the union of a partial order and an extra 
%   pair. Its call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |extend_partial_order| \word{name} \word{left} \word{right}
%   \end{quote}
%   and it returns the list of those pairs which were added to the 
%   partial order. This includes the pair 
%   $(\mathit{left},\mathit{right})$\Dash except in the case that 
%   the partial order already had \(\mathit{left} \leqslant 
%   \mathit{right}\) in which case an empty list is returned, but in 
%   those cases it is more efficient to not call this procedure.
%   
%   The data structures for a partial order consists of three arrays 
%   in the calling context: \meta{name}, \meta{name}|L|, and 
%   \meta{name}|R|. \meta{name} is the partial order itself, as a 
%   set of pairs (the indices are pairs, whereas the entries are 
%   ignored and set to the empty string). \meta{name}|L| and 
%   \meta{name}|R| are indexed by individual elements and the 
%   entries contain the lists of all those elements which are 
%   $\leqslant$ and $\geqslant$ respectively the index element. Each 
%   of the three arrays contains enough information to create the 
%   other two, but having the information in many different forms 
%   improves the asymptotic complexity.
%   \begin{tcl}

% \begin{proc}{cosequence_levels}
%   This procedure produces a simultaneous sequencing of a number of

%     |cosequence_levels| \word{pre-hints} \word{levels}
%     \word{post-hints}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where the \word{levels} is a list of levels (the first element is 
%   for the lowest level), and each level a list of 
%   item-specifications. An item-specification is a list with the 
%   structure
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{item name} \word{down-neighbours} \word{up-neighbours}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{item name} is the name of this particular item (must 
%   be unique within the \word{level-list}), whereas the 
%   \word{down-neighbours} and \word{up-neighbours} are lists of 
%   names of its neighbours (listed from left to right) in the levels 
%   below and above respectively the current level. It is assumed 
%   that items only have neighbours in neighbouring levels.
%   
%   The return value is a list of levels (in the same order as the 
%   \word{level list}), where each level is the list of items in that 
%   level, in sequence from left to right. The \word{pre-hints} and 
%   \word{post-hints} are lists of pairs of elements, interpreted as 
%   pairs of elements to try to incorporate into the partial order. 
%   The \word{pre-hints} pairs (if there are any) are processed 
%   before pairs deduced from \word{down-neighbours} and 
%   \word{up-neighbours} lists, whereas the \word{post-hints} pairs 
%   are taken into consideration after the first wave of propagations 
%   has died out. The \word{pre-hints} and \word{post-hints} may only 
%   contain pairs where both items are in the same level.

%   At this point, the wave of propagations has died out; there is no 
%   more information at hand. If the partial order is not total within 
%   each level, this means it is now necessary to make some kind of 
%   choice on how to extend the order. The way this is done is that 
%   the procedure starts appending minimum elements to the relevant 
%   entries in the |Res| array and at the same time removes them from 
%   the |Levelno| array. When an item is encountered which is not 
%   minimum in its level, the pairs missing to make it minimum are 
%   appended to the |queue| and another wave of propagations is 
%   allowed to carry the implications of this choice to all parts of 
%   the component.
%   
%   The arbitrary part of this algorithm is the manner in which 
%   items are ``encountered'' and checked for being minimum in their 
%   level. Each item is assigned a deficiency (for being 
%   minimal)\Ldash which is the number of elements that are missing 
%   from its |PR| entry for the item to be minimal among those in 
%   its level which have not yet been added to the |Res| entry for 
%   this level\Dash and the entries in the |Levelno| array are 
%   inspected in order of increasing deficiency. Since adding an item 
%   in a level to the result causes the current deficiency for all 
%   other items in that level to drop, the deficiency needs to be 
%   recomputed before determining whether it is necessary to make a 
%   choice.
%   \begin{tcl}

% The full-featured version of this would handle contradicting 
% propagations in a less sequential manner, by forming the transitive 
% closure $Q$ of the union of the old partial order $P$ with the 
% |queue| in a single step. This could make $Q$ a quasi-order with 
% nontrivial equivalence, so the algorithm would have to make 
% decisions on how to linearise equivalence classes as well as 
% extending the partial order. The total collection of ``moves'' for 
% sequencing the level would be:
% \begin{description}
%   \item[Transitive closure]
%     As described above.
%   \item[Neighbour propagation]
%     As in the simple variant.
%   \item[Dividing by equivalence]
%     It is reasonable to decide that elements of an equivalence 
%     class should at least be close in the linear order, or somewhat 
%     stronger that the equivalence classes should be intervals in 
%     the linear order. This corresponds to extracting all 
%     \emph{strict} inequalities from $Q$ and adding them back to 
%     $P$.
%   \item[Cycle cutting]
%     Every nontrivial equivalence class must contain a cycle. By 
%     cutting this cycle at its weakest link, one should obtain a 
%     good linearisation of it. How does one go ahead with that? One 
%     possibility is to compute a maximal circulation in the digraph 
%     of suggested inequalities (letting the multiplicity be the edge 
%     capacity) and then cut at an edge which is saturated.
% \end{description}
% The various moves should probably be tried in precisely that order, 
% since they represent increasing amounts of decision-making (and 
% probably also running time).

% \subsection{Continuous component sequencing}
% 
% This is a rather wild idea, which has one origin in the problem of 
% finding a \emph{layout} (see Subsection~\ref{Ssec:Layout}) for a 
% network. A layout assigns an $y$-coordinate to each level and an 
% $x$-coordinate to each item within a level. If the widths of 
% individual items are fixed, a sequencing of these items within a 
% level is given, and the items are packed tightly, then the 
% relative positions within a level are uniquely determined, but the 
% absolute positions are not since nothing constrains the horizontal 
% position of the slug that the level items have been fused into. 
% Obviously some principle for positioning levels relative to each 
% other is needed.
% 
% An obvious starting point for such a principle would be to look at 
% the edges\Ldash or rather edge segments, as an edge need not go 
% between two adjacent levels\Rdash between two levels, and a natural 
% quantity to minimise is their combined lengths. When several 
% lengths are to be combined in this kind of stuation, one usually 
% does so by taking the sum of the \emph{squares} of the lengths, as 
% that makes the algebra a lot simpler. In this situation, it for 
% example means that only the $x$-direction distances matter, as the 
% $y$-direction distances are constant. It also has the nice property 
% that the tension is distributed among the edges, since \(a^2 + 0^2 
% > (\frac{a}{2})^2 + (\frac{a}{2})^2\). From an algebraic 
% perspective, one really only does a least squares fitting and can 
% therefore compute the result in one go by making a suitable 
% projection!
% 
% Using this quantity as the one to optimise may not work too well 
% together with the sequencing algorithm of 
% Subsection~\ref{Ssec:UtvidgaPartialording} however, as that has a 
% tendency to sometimes make large jumps\Dash typically in the middle 
% of an edge between two very distant levels. Thus one may see 
% layouts like
% \[
%   \begin{matrix}
%     a& b& c& d\\
%     b& c& d& a\\
%     b& c& d& a\\
%     b& c& d& a
%   \end{matrix}
%   \quad\text{rather than}\quad
%   \begin{matrix}
%     a& b& c& d\\
%     b& a& c& d\\
%     b& c& a& d\\
%     b& c& d& a
%   \end{matrix}
% \]
% which humanly seems more natural; the former will have a long 
% $a$--$a$ edge between the first two levels, and minimising the 
% square-sum rather than e.g. the sum will in this case probably be 
% for the worse. In order to let a square-sum objective show its full 
% potential, it should really be allowed to influence the sequencing 
% of levels as well as the positioning of level slugs! But the 
% sequencing of levels is a very different beast to tame, as the 
% space over which one optimises is discrete rather than continuous.
% 
% A trivial approach to optmising the sequencing would be to consider 
% the graph with all possible sequencings as vertices, where there are 
% edges between two sequencings that differ only by a transposition 
% of two objects; starting at some vertex in this graph, one would look 
% at all neighbours, move to the one with smallest value of the 
% objective function, and repeat until a minimum is found.

% \subsection{Deconstruction}
% 
% Deconstruction of a network is the opposite of construction, i.e., 
% the conversion of a network to some text which might be used to 
% describe it.
% 
% \begin{proc}{lists_to_permutation}
%   This procedure takes two lists, which are assumed to contain the 
%   exact same distinct elements, and computes the permutation which 
%   converts one into the other. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |lists_to_permutation| \word{list B} \word{list A}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the defining property is that the \word{result} is such that 
%   the two commands
%   \begin{quote}
%     |lindex |\word{list B}|[lindex |\word{result}| |\word{index}|]|
%     \\
%     |lindex |\word{list A}| |\word{index}
%   \end{quote}
%   returns the same value for both inputs.
%   
%   In the case of a permutation network, the command
%   \begin{quote}
%     \raggedright
%     |lists_to_permutation [lindex |\word{network}| 0 0 2]\
%     [lindex |\word{network}| 0 1 1]|
%   \end{quote}
%   recovers the underlying permutation.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::pure::lists_to_permutation {BL AL} {
   set n -1; foreach x $BL {incr n
      set B($x) $n
   }
   set res {}
   foreach x $AL {lappend res $B($x)}
   return $res
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% \begin{proc}{deconstruct_permutation}
%   This procedure expresses a permutation as a combination of |.|s 
%   and \meta{k}|X|\meta{l}s. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |deconstruct_permutation| \word{permutation}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is a list of lists; the network constructed 
%   from the |join| by \verb*" \r " of this result is the network 
%   corresponding to the \word{permutation}.
%   
%   The algorithm decomposes the \word{permutation} from the input 
%   side, for each element of the result recomputing what remains of 
%   the \word{permutation}. A $\cross{k}{l}$ item is begun when an 
%   element is encountered that the current permutation maps to 
%   something larger, and this element will then be the first element 
%   in the $k$ leg of that cross. New elements are appended to the 
%   $k$ leg as long as they should be mapped to something greater 
%   than the first one, then the $l$ leg consists of the following 
%   sequence of elements mapped to something less than the first 
%   element in the $k$ leg. The algorithm terminates because each 
%   decomposition step reduces the number of inversions in the 
%   permutation, by $kl$ for each \meta{$k$}\texttt{X}\meta{$l$} 
%   output.
%   
%   The |line| variable collects an element for the output, whereas 
%   the |new| variable collects the remaining part of the 
%   permutation. |K| is the list of elements currently in the $k$ leg 
%   of a cross and |l| is the number of elements currently in 
%   the $l$ leg.

%   The |>=| below is a slight safeguard against faulty input: if 
%   the \word{permutation} contains repeated elements then the loop

% \begin{proc}{deconstruct_graded}
%   This procedure converts a graded network to lists like those in

%   syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |deconstruct_graded| \word{network} \word{levels-list}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is the list of lists, which if |join|ed by

%   reconstructing the \word{network} (or at least the component of 
%   it that is mentioned in the \word{levels-list}). It is assumed 
%   that the first element of the \word{levels-list} is for the 
%   output level and the last element is for the input level; either 
%   or both may be empty, but they must be present.
%   
%   Some elements of the result correspond directly to elements of 
%   the \word{levels-list} (although in the opposite order), whereas 
%   others are needed to express how intermediate edges connect 
%   different levels. The result is probably shorter if the

% \section{Networks with feedback}
% 
% The relevant context for substitutions is not networks as such, but 
% networks together with a list of \emph{feedback opportunities}. A 
% \emph{pure network with feedback} is thus a pair
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{network} \word{feedback-list}
% \end{quote}
% where \word{network} is a pure network and \word{feedback-list} is a 
% list of pairs
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{output-index} \word{input-index}
% \end{quote}
% where each pair $(i,j)$ means output $i$ of \word{network} may be fed 
% back into input $j$ of the network. This list of pairs is the 
% complement of the input--output order relation, since it is expected 
% that it will usually be much smaller.
% 
% Procedures operating on networks with feedback are kept in the 
% |network::wfb| namespace.
% \begin{tcl}
namespace eval network::wfb {}
% \end{tcl}
% \setnamespace{network::wfb}
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{full}
%   The |full| procedure discards the \word{feedback-list} part of a 
%   network with feedback and replaces it with the list of all possible 
%   feedbacks. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::wfb::full| \word{network}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is full variant of the same network.
%   
%   The idea of this procedure is to compute the partial order on the 
%   edges of the network, and then list those inputs and outputs which 
%   are not related by this order.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::wfb::full {NW} {
   set n -1; foreach e [lindex $NW 0 1] {incr n
      set P($n,$n) ""
   }
   foreach v [lindex $NW 0 0] {
      set aboveL {}
      foreach e [lindex $v 2] {
         foreach pair [array names P $e,*] {
            lappend aboveL [lindex [split $pair ","] 1]
         }
      }
      set belowL {}
      foreach e [lindex $v 1] {
         foreach pair [array names P *,$e] {
            lappend belowL [lindex [split $pair ","] 0]
         }
      }
      set belowL [lsort -integer -unique $belowL]
      foreach i [lsort -integer -unique $aboveL] {
         foreach j $belowL {
            set P($j,$i) ""
         }
      }
   }
   set L {}
   set i -1; foreach ei [lindex $NW 0 0 0 2] {incr i
      set j -1; foreach ej [lindex $NW 0 0 1 1] {incr j
         if {![info exists P($ei,$ej)]} then {
            lappend L [list $i $j]
         }
      }
   }
   return [list [lindex $NW 0] $L]
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% It is sometimes useful to compute the effects on feedbacks of 
% various operations without having to compute the effect also on 
% some network. For that purpose, there is also a datatype 
% \emph{feedback-sort}, which is a list
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{coarity} \word{arity} \word{feedback-list}
% \end{quote}
% where \word{coarity} and \word{arity} are integers. It should be 
% observed that this sort is sufficient information about the 
% operands of many operations if one wants to determine the sort of 
% the result.
% 
% Procedures operating on feedback-sorts are kept in the 
% |network::fbs| namespace.
% \begin{tcl}
namespace eval network::fbs {}
% \end{tcl}
% 
% \begin{proc}{to_fbs}
%   The |to_fbs| procedure computes the feedback-sort of a network 
%   with feedback. It has the call syntax
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::wfb::to_fbs| \word{network}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is the feedback-sort.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::wfb::to_fbs {NW} {
   list [llength [lindex $NW 0 0 0 2]] [llength [lindex $NW 0 0 1 1]]\
     [lindex $NW 1]
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% \begin{proc}{map_to_fbs}
%   The |map_to_fbs| procedure has the call syntax
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::wfb::map_to_fbs| \word{prefix} \word{network-list}
%   \end{quote}
%   It behaves mostly as
%   \begin{quote}
%     |namespace eval network::fbs| \word{prefix} \word{network-list}
%   \end{quote}
%   \emph{except} that it converts all elements in the 
%   \word{network-list} to feedback-sorts before making the call. The 
%   idea for this is that the \word{prefix} should be looked up in the 
%   |network::fbs| namespace, so that a feedback-sort operation is 
%   applied to its arguments. This way, code in the |network::wfb| 
%   namespace can call upon an operation from the |network::fbs| 
%   namespace without having to bother about giving its full name.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::wfb::map_to_fbs {prefix nwL} {
   foreach nw $nwL {lappend prefix [to_fbs $nw]}
   namespace eval [namespace parent]::fbs $prefix
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% \subsection{\PROP py operations}
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{composition}
%   This procedure computes the composition of a list of networks 
%   with feedback, i.e., it places them all in sequence (with the 
%   first on the output side). The syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::wfb::composition| \word{network}\regplus
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is the resulting network. It is typically 
%   not on canonical form. It is an error if the number of outputs in 
%   one network does not match the number of inputs in the following.
%   
%   The implementation first composes the pure networks, then their 
%   feedback-sorts.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::wfb::composition {args} {
   list [
      eval [linsert $args 0 [namespace parent]::pure::composition]
   ] [
      lindex [map_to_fbs composition $args] 2
   ]
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}[network::fbs]{composition}
%   This procedure computes the composition of a list of 
%   feedback-sorts for networks, i.e., it places them all in sequence 
%   (with the first on the output side). The syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::fbs::composition| \word{feedback-sort}\regplus
%   \end{quote}
%   and the return value is the result feedback-sort.
%   
%   Composing anti-feedbacks is essentially boolean matrix 
%   multiplication\Ldash there's an anti-feedback from input $i$ to 
%   output $k$ in $a \circ b$ if there is some $j$ such that $a$ has 
%   an anti-feedback from $i$ to $j$ and $b$ has an anti-feedback 
%   from $j$ to $k$\Dash so one shouldn't expect that this can done 
%   in subcubic time.\footnote{Unless one starts to play some very 
%   nasty tricks, like Strassen matrix multiplication or striped 
%   matrix multiplication\Dash which would be utterly wasted in this 
%   case.} Under the assumption that the complementary feedbacks are 
%   few, it may however be possible to achieve better average results.
%   
%   Expressed in feedbacks, the composition rule is that there is a 
%   feedback from output $k$ to input $i$ in a composition iff every 
%   point of join $j$ is covered by a feedback from $j$ to $i$ or a 
%   feedback from $k$ to $j$. Hence a natural data structure is that 
%   one for every output $k$ of the left operand and every input $i$ 
%   of the right operand has a list of join indices $j$ which are 
%   covered by feedbacks from $k$, and to $i$, respectively. When 
%   deciding whether to put a feedback from $k$ to $i$, it is then 
%   sufficient to check the two corresponding lists to see if these 
%   cover every join index. The innermost loop can then be put into 
%   a |lsort -unique|.
%   
%   For left operands (partial compositions), the |FBL| variable is a 
%   list indexed by output index $k$, and the elements are those $j$ 
%   values for which there are $k$-to-$j$ feedbacks. The |FBR| 
%   variable is a similar list, which is indexed by input index $i$ 
%   and where the elements are lists of those $j$ values for which 
%   there are $j$-to-$i$ feedbacks.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::fbs::composition {left args} {
   foreach pair [lindex $left 2] {
      lappend A([lindex $pair 0]) [lindex $pair 1]
   }

      lappend FBL [lappend A([llength $FBL])]
   }

% \subsection{Listing isomorphic subnetworks}
% 
% 
% \begin{proc}{instances}
%   The |instances| procedure determines the instances in which the 
%   network $H$ occurs within the network $G$. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::wfb::instances| \word{network $G$} \word{network $H$} 
%     \word{limit}\regopt
%   \end{quote}
%   where the \word{limit} (an non-negative integer) is the maximal 
%   number of instances returned. The return value is a list of those 
%   regions (as defined in Subsection~\ref{Ssec:Regionkirurgi}) which 
%   constitute instances of $H$ (i.e., which would |uncover| a 
%   subnetwork isomorphic to $H$).
%   
%   Note that this operation is applied to networks \emph{with 
%   feedback}; an instance is not accepted if it would require more 
%   feedback opportunities than $H$ provides.
%   
%   
%   In the implementation, the most important data structure is the 
%   \emph{correspondence} 
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{$f_0$} \word{$f_1$} \word{$f_2$} \word{$f_3$}
%   \end{quote}
%   which is a list whose elements are four maps 
%   \(f_0\colon \GV(H) \Fpil \GV(G) \cup\{-1\}\), \(f_1\colon \GV(G) 
%   \Fpil \GV(H) \cup\{-1\}\), \(f_2\colon \GE(H) \Fpil \GE(G) 
%   \cup\{-1\}\), and \(f_3\colon \GE(G) \Fpil {}\)segmentations; 
%   these maps are encoded as lists indexed by the argument. $f_0$ maps 
%   vertices in $H$ to the corresponding vertices of $G$, and $f_1$ 
%   does it the other way around; unassigned vertices are mapped to 
%   $-1$. $f_2$ maps edges in $H$ to the corresponding edges of $G$, 
%   and $f_3$ specifies the composition with respect to $H$ of an edge 
%   in $G$. A segmentation is a list
%   \begin{quote}
%     \begin{regblock}[\regstar]\word{type} 
%     \word{$H$-edge}\end{regblock}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{type} is one of
%   \begin{longtable}{lp{0.7\textwidth}}
%     \texttt{head}& Head part of edge (input leg)\\
%     \texttt{mid}& Middle part of edge (stray edge)\\
%     \texttt{tail}& Tail part of edge (output leg)\\
%     \texttt{all}& Whole edge (internal edge)
%   \end{longtable}
%   
%   \begin{proc}{instances,region}
%     This procedure converts a \word{correspondence} to a 
%     \word{region}. The call syntax is
%     \begin{quote}
%       |instances,region| \word{$H$-network} \word{correspondence}
%     \end{quote}
%     where the \word{$H$-network} is pure.
%     \begin{tcl}
proc network::wfb::instances,region {NW corr} {

%     \end{tcl}
%   \end{proc}
%   
%   
%   \begin{proc}{instances,expand}
%     The |instances,expand| procedure expands a correspondence with 
%     everything that can be deduced from an assignment of one 
%     additional vertex. The call syntax is
%     \begin{quote}
%       |instances,expand| \word{correspondence} 
%       \word{network $G$ (pure)} \word{network $H$ (pure)} 
%       \word{$G$-vertex} \word{$H$-vertex}
%     \end{quote}
%     and the return value is the extended correspondence, or an 
%     empty list if the mapping couldn't be extended as specified. 
%     \word{network $G$} and \word{network $H$} are pure networks, 
%     \word{$G$-vertex} and \word{$H$-vertex} are vertex labels.
%     
%     The implementation employs a straightforward |queue| of 
%     elements on one of the three forms
%     \begin{quote}
%       |vertex| \word{$G$-vertex} \word{$H$-vertex}\\
%       |edgefw| \word{$G$-edge} \word{$H$-edge}\\
%       |edgebw| \word{$G$-edge} \word{$H$-edge}
%     \end{quote}
%     |vertex| items are vertex assignments, just as the one in the 
%     argument. The other two forms are edge assignments. The 
%     processing of a queue element must first check whether the 
%     assignment has already been made (and if so go on to the next 
%     queue element), second check that the correspondence is possible, 
%     and third propage the correspondence by adding queue elements 
%     for assignments of neighbouring edges or vertices. 
%     
%     Propagations along an edge only go to the vertex at the other 
%     end of that edge, but a |vertex| generate assignments for all 
%     edges it is incident with. Most of the time this means at least 
%     one edge already assigned is getting a new assignment, but it 
%     is less work to generate and process this queue element that it 
%     would be to avoid it. Generating a queue element also means it 
%     is checked that the head\slash tail index of the edges match, 
%     which means edge propagation need not explicitly check this. 
%     \begin{tcl}

%   
%   A tricky matter is what it means for an feedback opportunity to be 
%   needed. The theoretical foundation lies instead in the complementary 
%   dependence relation from outputs to inputs, in terms of which the 
%   condition is that (i)~if an $H$-input in $G$ has a dependence on an 
%   $H$-output then $H$ must have a feedback allowing this dependence, 
%   and (ii)~the stated dependencies in $H$ must not give rise to any 
%   new dependencies in $G$. The main tool for checking this is the 
%   \emph{$H$-dependency matrix}, which for symmetry with dependency 
%   relations computed by the |edgeorder| procedure is such that
%   \begin{quote}
%     |lindex| \word{matrix} \word{out-index} \word{in-index}
%   \end{quote}
%   is |1| if the $H$-output with index \word{out-index} depends on 
%   the $H$-input with index \word{in-index} and |0| otherwise.
%   
%   
%   \begin{proc}{instances,H-dep}
%     This procedure updates the $H$-dependecy matrix by adding to it 
%     such dependencies that result from a given 
%     \word{correspondence}; it is meant to be used after all 
%     vertices (but none of the stray edges, since it ignores the 
%     exact segmentation of an edge) have been assigned. The return 
%     value is the updated matrix. This procedure may also |return| 
%     with a |-code continue|, which happens in the case that the 
%     \word{correspondence} turned out to be incompatible with the 
%     dependencies in $H$.
%     The call syntax is
%     \begin{quote}
%       \raggedright
%       |instances,H-dep| \word{$H$-dependency-matrix} 
%       \word{$G$-dependecy-arr} \word{correspondence} 
%       \word{$H$-network (with feedback)}  
%     \end{quote}
%     where the \word{$G$-dependecy-arr} is the name in the calling 
%     context of the array encoding the edge-dependency relation of 
%     $G$.
%     
%     More formally, there is a dependence of $H$-output $j$ on 
%     $H$-input $k$ if there is a ``dependency path'' from $j$ to 
%     $k$. A dependency path may go by two types of edge: explicit 
%     dependencies in $G$, as recorded in the 
%     \word{$G$-dependecy-arr}, and potential dependencies in $H$, as 
%     not forbidden by a feedback of $H$. Dependencies corresponding 
%     to a path with one edge of the second type are present in the 
%     input \word{$H$-dependency-matrix}, but dependencies needing to 
%     make use of paths of the first type are probably missing and 
%     have to be added. Since the $H$-dependencies are directed (from 
%     input to output), the $G$-dependencies that are of interest are 
%     those that go the other way (an input depends on an output).
%     
%     An abstract phrasing of the problem is that there is a 
%     bipartite graph with $X_i$ (the input indices) being the set of 
%     vertices on one side and $X_o$ (the output indices) being the 
%     set of vertices on the other. This graph has two kinds of 
%     edges: $H$-edges (corresponding to a dependency of output on 
%     input) and $G$-edges (corresponding to a dependency of input on 
%     output). What needs to be computed is the relation between 
%     inputs and outputs that there exists an alternating path 
%     (starting and ending with $H$-edges) from the input to the 
%     output, and the method used is a loop over the $G$-edges, where 
%     at each step new $H$-edges are inserted for every length $3$ 
%     alternating path with the $G$-edge as middle edge. At the same 
%     time, it is necessary to detect alternating cycles, since these 
%     are direct acyclicity violations. It is however sufficient to 
%     check for such cycles of length $2$, since chords are being 
%     inserted into longer cycles as part of the processing of 
%     altnernating paths.
%     
%     As a first step, lists of $H$-inputs and $H$-outputs are 
%     prepared, in the forms of $G$-edge-labels (|Li| and |Lo|) and 
%     $H$-in/out-indices (|Xi| and |Xo|). Once this is done, neither 
%     the \word{correspondence} nor the \word{$H$-network} are needed 
%     anymore.
%     \begin{tcl}

   }
%     \end{tcl}
%     The second step is the loop over $G$-edges, in the form of the 
%     two outer |foreach| loops. The two inner |foreach| loops are

%     \end{tcl}
%   \end{proc}
%   
%   The main loop in |instances| is a depth first search through the 
%   tree of possible vertex and edge assignments. For this search, 
%   there is a |stack| whose elements are lists of one of the forms
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{correspondence} \word{$H$-dependencies} |vertex| 
%       \word{vHL-index}\\
%     \word{correspondence} \word{$H$-dependencies} |edge| 
%       \word{$H$-input-index}
%   \end{quote}
%   where the |vertex| form represent that the next step is to 
%   assign a vertex (if any remain), and the |edge| form represent 
%   that the next step is to assign a stray edge (if any remain). The 
%   two index items are the indices (in the |vHL| list and as 
%   $H$-input, respectively) of the next vertex or edge that is not 
%   necessarily already assigned\Dash these indices should be 
%   incremented until an unassigned item is found or no more items of 
%   this type remain.
%   
%   \begin{proc}{instances,edgechoices}
%     For the assignment of stray edges, dependencies are taken into 
%     account from the start: an assignment doesn't make it to the 
%     |stack| if it leads to dependency cycles. As the basic 
%     principles of edge segmentation (an |all| edge is completely used 
%     up, a |tail| segment must be first, and a |head| segment must be 
%     last) are not particularly restrictive, the dependencies are 
%     significant factors in reducing the valency of the search tree.
%     
%     The call syntax of this procedure is
%     \begin{quote}
%       \raggedright
%       |instances,edgechoices| \word{$H$-edge} \word{correspondence} 
%       \word{$H$-network (pure)} \word{$H$-matrix} 
%       \word{$G$-dependecy-arr}
%     \end{quote}
%     and the return value the list of all assignments (in the form 
%     of elements to push onto the stack) of the $H$-edge that 
%     satisfy the segmentation and $H$-dependency restrictions.
%     
%     The main task in this procedure is to compute the $H$-matrix 
%     for each assignment returned. New dependencies may arise 
%     (i)~because of a $G$-dependency of the input or (ii)~because of 
%     a $G$-dependency on the output, but it is not necessary to 
%     consider combinations (an $HGHGH$-path), since a $GHG$-path 
%     with an assignment of the edge for the $H$ part is already 
%     present in the $G$-dependency relation; hence it is (as before) 
%     sufficient to look for $HGH$-dependency paths, where one 
%     endpoint of the $G$ part is one end of the \word{$H$-edge} 
%     being added. Most things need to be done once for the output 
%     end and another time for the input end, but that's the way it is.
%     
%     The main loop in this procedure is over the edges of $G$, where 
%     |n| is the label of the $G$-edge to which an assignment is 
%     currently being considered. |ni| and |no| are the $H$-input and 
%     $H$-output indices of the |edge| being assigned.
%     \begin{tcl}
proc network::wfb::instances,edgechoices\
  {edge corr NW H_mat Gdepname} {
   upvar 1 $Gdepname G_dep
   set ni [lindex $NW 1 $edge 3]
   set no [lindex $NW 1 $edge 1]
%     \end{tcl}
%     First lists |Li| and |Lo| of all involved $G$-edge labels 
%     corresponding to $H$-inputs and $H$-outputs, and matching lists 
%     |Xi| and |Xo| of their indices are construced. Two sublists 
%     |Yi| and |Yo| of the indices of $H$-legs of which the edge to 
%     assign has a dependence: |Yo| lists the outputs $H$-dependent 
%     on input |ni|, whereas |Yi| lists the inputs on which |no| is 
%     $H$-dependent.
%     \begin{tcl}
   set Li {}; set Xi {}; set Yi {}
   foreach ei [lindex $NW 0 1 1] d [lindex $H_mat $no] {
      lappend Li [lindex $corr 2 $ei]
      lappend Xi [llength $Xi]

      lappend Xo [llength $Xo]
      if {[lindex $row $ni]} then {lappend Yo [lindex $Xo end]}
   }
   set nextindex [expr {$ni + 1}]
%     \end{tcl}
%     Now comes the main loop. There will often be quite a number of 
%     iterations of it, but at least those edges which already have 
%     been wholly assigned can be skipped quickly.
%     \begin{tcl}
   set res {}
   set n -1; foreach segL [lindex $corr 3] {incr n
      if {[lindex $segL 0] eq "all"} then {continue}
%     \end{tcl}
%     The next step is to list (in |Zo|) those $H$-outputs on which 
%     there is a $G$-dependence in edge |n| and (in |Zi|) those 
%     $H$-inputs which $G$-depend on edge |n|. The |Yi| and |Zi| 
%     lists are disjoint, as are the |Yo| and |Zo| lists, unless 
%     there is a dependency loop. Inputs and outputs which themselves 
%     have been assigned to |n| are not included in |Zi| and |Zo|, 
%     since their statuses typically depend on the exact position 
%     within the edge; that is handled in an inner loop over |segL|.
%     \begin{tcl}
      set ok 1
      set Zo {}
      foreach leg $Lo xo $Xo {
         if {$leg == $n || $leg == -1} then {continue}
         if {[info exists "G_dep($n $leg)"]} then {
            if {[lindex $H_mat $xo $ni]} then {set ok 0; break}
            lappend Zo $xo
         }
      }
      if {!$ok} then {continue}
      set Zi {}
      foreach leg $Li xi $Xi {
         if {$leg == $n || $leg == -1} then {continue}
         if {[info exists "G_dep($leg $n)"]} then {
            if {[lindex $H_mat $no $xi]} then {set ok 0; break}
            lappend Zi $xi
         }
      }
      if {!$ok} then {continue}
%     \end{tcl}
%     
%     The $H$-dependency matrices to put in the results are 
%     constructed by setting some positions in |H_mat| to |1|\Dash 
%     the trucky part is how to efficiently determine which, 
%     especially since different positions in |segL| may lead to 
%     different patterns. One factor in this are the |Yo| and |Yi| 
%     lists, since if some |$no $xi| or |$xo $ni| entry should be set 
%     to |1|, then the same should hold for |$no| or |$ni| replaced 
%     by any other element of |$Yo| or |$Yi|; what varies between 
%     different assignments are the |xi| and |xo| indices to set. 
%     This is instead kept track of using two additional lists |Mi| 
%     and |Mo|, which have the same number of elements as |Xi| and 
%     |Xo| respectively. The element with index |$xi| in |Mi| is 
%     positive if input |$ni| has a dependence on input |$xi|, 
%     similarly the element with index |$xo| in |Mo| is positive if 
%     output |$xo| has a dependence on output |$no|.
%     
%     As a first step, the segmentation-independent dependencies are 
%     entered into this list.
%     \begin{tcl}
      set Mo {}
      foreach xo $Xo {
         lappend Mo 0
         foreach xi $Zi {
            if {[lindex $H_mat $xo $xi]} then {
               lset Mo end 1; break
            }
         }
      }
      set Mi {}
      foreach xi $Xi {
         lappend Mi 0
         foreach xo $Zo {
            if {[lindex $H_mat $xo $xi]} then {
               lset Mi end 1; break
            }
         }
      }
%     \end{tcl}
%     When checking dependencies within an edge, the exact segment 
%     position matters. The idea is to let |ok| be $1$ minus the number 
%     of dependency conditions violated at the current position, so 
%     that one doesn't have to recheck each condition for each 
%     position. The |Mi| and |Mo| lists are similarly incremented by 
%     the number of dependencies that are relevant at the current 
%     position, to allow for simple updates.
%     
%     First walk through the |segL| to compute the state at the tail 
%     end of the edge, then walk through it again to actually 
%     produce assignments for each position. The |Mi| list already 
%     has the correct value for this position, but the |Mo| list 
%     rather has the correct value for the head end of the edge, and 
%     needs to be updated.
%     \begin{tcl}
      foreach {type leg} $segL {
         set xi [lindex $NW 1 $leg 3]
         if {$type eq "tail" || [lindex $H_mat $no $xi]}\

         }
         set Mo $M
      }
%     \end{tcl}
%     In the loop over positions, a |dummy| final segment is added 
%     to make the loop cover also the position after the last 
%     previous item.
%     \begin{tcl}
      set p -2; foreach {type leg} [linsert $segL end dummy] {incr p 2

%     If this position is |ok| with all dependencies, then build the

%   
%   The first part of the |instances| procedure compiles a list |vHL| 
%   of $H$-vertex labels in an order that should speed up the search. 
%   The idea is to first process vertices of a type that is rare in $G$, 
%   to reduce the number of possibilities that needs to be tried. There 
%   is also a subordinate ordering that types are tried first which are 
%   more common in $H$; the rationale for this is that subsequent 
%   vertices of this type have fewer possibilities available.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::wfb::instances {NWG NWH {limit infinity}} {
   set n -1; foreach v [lindex $NWG 0 0] {incr n
      if {$n<2} then {continue}
      lappend TypeG([lindex $v 0]) $n
   }
   set n -1; foreach v [lindex $NWH 0 0] {incr n
      if {$n<2} then {continue}
      lappend TypeH([lindex $v 0]) $n
   }
   set L {}
   foreach type [array names TypeH] {
      if {![info exists TypeG($type)]} then {return ""}
      lappend L [list $type [llength $TypeG($type)]\
        [llength $TypeH($type)]]
      if {[lindex $L end 1] < [lindex $L end 2]} then {return ""}
   }
   set vHL {}
   foreach type [
      lsort -integer -index 1 [lsort -integer -decreasing -index 2 $L]
   ] {
      eval [list lappend vHL] $TypeH([lindex $type 0])
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   The second part stores the dependency order on the edges of $G$ 
%   into the array |G_dep|. It also computes the matrices |H_mat| and 
%   |G_mat| of declared $H$- and $G$-dependencies. |G_mat| will 
%   eventually figure as $A$ in the call to |instances,matgeqprod|, 
%   whereas |H_mat| (after some updates) ends up as $B_2$ in that 
%   call. $B_1$ and $B_3$ are computed from |G_dep|, but only when 
%   there is a complete correspondence to test. Finally it constructs 
%   an empty correspondence and places the root of the search tree on 
%   the |stack|.
%   \begin{tcl}
   [namespace parent]::pure::edgeorder [lindex $NWG 0] G_dep 
   [namespace parent]::setconstlist\
     H_mat 1 [lindex $NWH 0 0 1 1] \

     L3 {} [lindex $NWG 0 1]
   set stack [list [list [list $L0 $L1 $L2 $L3] $H_mat vertex 0]]
%   \end{tcl}
%   The main loop continues until the |limit| has been reached or the 
%   stack is empty. The first part of it pops an element off the 
%   stack and brances according to its type.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set res {}
   while {[llength $res] < $limit && [llength $stack]} {

      set stack [lreplace $stack [set stack end] end]
      switch -- $type "vertex" {
%   \end{tcl}
%   When the search is in the |vertex| phase, it quickly scans ahead 
%   for the first unassigned vertex and expands all assignments of 
%   that vertex, pushing those that succeed onto the stack. (Note: 
%   If assignment expansion is slow, then this could slow down the 
%   procedure unnecessarily in the case that a |limit| is provided.) 
%   \begin{tcl}
         foreach v [lrange $vHL $index end] {
            if {[lindex $corr 0 $v] == -1} then {
               foreach u $TypeG([lindex $NWH 0 0 $v 0]) {
                  if {[lindex $corr 1 $u] == -1} then {
                     set corr2 [
                        instances,expand $corr [lindex $NWG 0]\
                          [lindex $NWH 0] $u $v
                     ]

               }
               break
            }
            incr index
         }
%   \end{tcl}
%   If all vertices were already assigned, then check whether 
%   dependencies so far are OK and proceed to assign stray edges. 
%   Remember that |instances,H-dep| will issue a |continue| when the 
%   dependencies are not OK.
%   \begin{tcl}
         if {$index >= [llength $vHL]} then {

            ] edge 0]
         }
      } "edge" {
%   \end{tcl}
%   The |edge| phase of the search has a similar overall 
%   structure\Ldash there is an outer loop over the object that may 
%   need to be assigned, and an inner loop over the possibilities 
%   there are for assigning it\Dash but here the inner loop is part 
%   of the helper procedure |instances,edgechoices|.
%   \begin{tcl}
         foreach e [lrange [lindex $NWH 0 0 1 1] $index end] {

%   In the case that all legs have been successfully assigned, it is

% Since all the above is rather complicated, the now follows a couple of

% network surgery routines.
% 
% \begin{proc}[]{verify_instances}
%   This is a helper for some of the tests, which checks that the 
%   results are really the expected ones. The call syntax is
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     |verify_instances| \word{network $G$} \word{network $H$} 
%     \word{\#unspecified} \begin{regblock}[\regstar]
%     \word{network $G \div H$} \word{count} \end{regblock}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where \word{network $G$} and \word{network $H$} are as for 
%   |instances| itself. The remaining arguments are indirect 
%   specifications of the instances expected to be found: each 
%   \word{network $G \div H$} should be a pure network obtained by 
%   |detach|ing some instance of $H$ from $G$, and the following 
%   \word{count} is the number of such instances there should be. The 
%   \word{\#unspecified} is the number of instances for which $G \div 
%   H$ had not been computed; it can be equal to one of the 
%   \word{network $G \div H$}, but it is more likely that it is not. 
%   In all cases, it is checked that the regions found are isomorphic 
%   to $H$ and that |annex|ing $H$ to any $G \div H$ produces a 
%   network isomorphic to $G$.
%   
%   The return value is a report on discrepancies encountered. When 
%   all is well, that report is empty.

% \subsection{Ambiguities}
% 
% The mechanism driving a rewriting system completion procedure is the 
% construction of a critical set of ambiguities from a pair of rewrite 
% rules. For the networks considered here, a suitable format is that an 
% ambiguity is a list
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{site} \word{region 1} \word{region 2}
% \end{quote}
% where \word{site} is the network with feedback at which the ambiguity 
% is to be found, and \word{region 1} and \word{region 2} are the 
% regions within this network which would be replaced by the two rules 
% from which the ambiguity is formed.
% 
% \begin{proc}{ambiguities}
%   The |ambiguities| procedure computes the list of all ambiguities 
%   that can be formed by overlapping two networks. The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::wfb::ambiguities| \word{network 1} \word{network 2}
%   \end{quote}
%   where the arguments are networks with feedback. The return value is 
%   a list of ambiguities as above, where \word{network 1} corresponds 
%   to \word{region 1} and \word{network 2} to \word{region 2}. 
%   
%   The algorithm is again a depth-first search through the tree of 
%   possible identifications of vertices of one network with vertices 
%   of the other. For each node of the search tree, there is a partial 
%   \word{site} network containing \word{network 1}, and the search 
%   proceeds by extending it with vertices from \word{network 2}, one 
%   at a time, or by joining up legs, also one at a time. 
%   
%   The data structure for a partial \word{site} is a list with ten 
%   elements
%   \begin{quote}
%     \raggedright
%     \word{vertices} \word{edges} \word{output-list} \word{input-list} 
%     \word{feedbacks} \word{correspondence} \word{2-output-list} 
%     \word{2-input-list} \word{out-dependence table} 
%     \word{in-dependence table}
%   \end{quote}
%   The \word{vertices} and \word{edges} together make up something 
%   which mostly conforms to the definition of a pure network, but there 
%   are some deviations. In the \word{vertices}, elements $0$ and $1$ 
%   are not updated; instead the \word{output-list} and 
%   \word{input-list} record outputs and inputs respectively of the 
%   network under construction. Elements of these lists are edge labels 
%   or $-1-e$ for an edge label $e$, where the latter case means $e$ 
%   used to be an output or input leg but has since been joined up with 
%   some other leg and is now an internal edge; input and output indices 
%   are not recycled when the site is being constructed. In the 
%   \word{edges}, elements are either normal edges (lists of length 
%   four) or lists of length one; in the latter case this element is a 
%   placeholder for a former input leg which have been joined up with 
%   some output leg to form an internal edge. The element in such a 
%   one-element list is the label of the edge with which the former 
%   edge was joined.
%   
%   The \word{feedbacks} is an ordinary list of feedbacks, where the 
%   indices in each feedback are indices into the \word{output-list} 
%   and \word{input-list}. 
%   The \word{correspondence} is a pair of lists, where the first is 
%   indexed by \word{network 2} vertex labels and has as element the 
%   corresponding label of a vertex in the \word{network} (or |-1| if 
%   there is none), and the second list conversely is indexed by 
%   \word{network} vertex labels and has as element the corresponding 
%   label of a vertex in \word{network 2} (or |-1| if there is none). 
%   The \word{2-output-list} and \word{2-input-list} are lists of the 
%   \word{site} network edge labels that correspond to outputs and 
%   inputs of \word{network 2}; elements corresponding to legs that 
%   have not yet been placed are set to |-1|. The \word{out-dependence 
%   table} is a matrix where the first index is an index into 
%   \word{output-list}, the second index is and index into 
%   \word{2-output-list}, and an entry is |1| iff the current 
%   correspondence would make the site-output dependent on the 
%   \word{network 2} output. The \word{in-dependence table} is 
%   similarly a matrix where the first index is an index into 
%   \word{input-list}, the second index is and index into 
%   \word{2-input-list}, and an entry is |1| iff the current 
%   correspondence would make the \word{network 2} input dependent on 
%   the site-input.
%   
%   \begin{proc}{ambiguities,connect}
%     The |connect| helper to |ambiguities| connects two legs of a 
%     \word{site} and updates its feedbacks accordingly. The call 
%     syntax is
%     \begin{quote}
%       |ambiguities,connect| \word{site} \word{network-2-edge}
%     \end{quote}
%     and the return value is the modified \word{site}, or an empty 
%     list if the legs could not be connected. The 
%     \word{network-2-edge} is the list
%     \begin{quote}
%       \word{head-vertex} \word{head-index} \word{tail-vertex} 
%       \word{tail-index}
%     \end{quote}
%     defining an edge in \word{network 2}.
%     
%     The first step is to check that the assingment (hasn't been 
%     made already and) is possible. Apart from that the legs still 
%     have to be legs, this requires going through the feedbacks to 
%     see if there is one from the out-leg to the in-leg. At the 
%     same time, lists are constructed of inputs on which the 
%     out-leg does not depend and outputs which do not depend 
%     on the in-leg.
%     \begin{tcl}
proc network::wfb::ambiguities,connect {site edge2} {
   foreach {head hi tail ti} $edge2 break

   }
   if {!$ok} then {return ""}
%     \end{tcl}
%     The second part modifies the network, input, and output parts 
%     of the \word{site}.
%     \begin{tcl}
   lset site 1 $outleg 0 [lindex $site 1 $inleg 0]
   lset site 1 $outleg 1 [lindex $site 1 $inleg 1]
   lset site 1 $inleg [list $outleg]

   lset site 2 $outx [expr {-1 - $outleg}]
   lset site 3 $inx [expr {-1 - $inleg}]
%     \end{tcl}
%     The third part rebuilds the feedback list to remove those which 
%     are no longer possible. |state_iL| and |state_oL| are lists 
%     detailing the status of inputs and outputs: an entry is |1| if 
%     the leg has a dependency relation with the newly-joined edge 
%     and |0| otherwise. Feedbacks must be removed not only if they 
%     go to the newly-joined edge, but also if they form a cycle 
%     through it.
%     \begin{tcl}
   [namespace parent]::setconstlist state_iL 1 [lindex $site 3] \

%     \end{tcl}
%     The fourth part adds dependencies to the in- and

%     \end{tcl}
%   \end{proc}
%   
%   \begin{proc}{ambiguities,extend}
%     The |extend| helper to |ambiguities| adds a loose vertex to a 
%     \word{site}. The call syntax is
%     \begin{quote}
%       |ambiguities,extend| \word{site} \word{vertex}
%     \end{quote}
%     where \word{vertex} has the form of the entry for an individual 
%     vertex in a network; the only information used is the annotation, 
%     the number of outputs, and the number of inputs. The label of the 
%     new vertex equals the number of vertices in the \word{site}.
%     
%     The main complication in this procedure is that feedbacks must 
%     be added between legs of the new vertex and legs of the 
%     previous network.

%   
%   \begin{proc}{ambiguities,expand}
%     The |expand| helper of |ambiguities| is in charge of actually 
%     establishing the \word{correspondence} part of a site, by 
%     starting from a pair of vertices that should correspond to each 
%     other. It also handles removal of feedbacks that would 
%     contradict dependencies of \word{network 2} and listing legs 
%     where the site needs to be |extend|ed.
%     
%     The call syntax is
%     \begin{quote}
%       \raggedright
%       |ambiguities,expand| \word{queue-var} \word{site} 
%       \word{network 2 (pure)} \word{dependency matrix} 
%       \word{site-vertex} \word{2-vertex}
%     \end{quote}
%     and the return value is the \word{site} updated with an extended 
%     correspondence, or an empty list if the given assignment is 
%     inconsistent with the \word{site} and \word{network 2}. 
%     \word{2-vertex} is the label of a vertex in \word{network 2}, 
%     whereas \word{site-vertex} is the label in the \word{site} to 
%     which it should be assigned. The \word{dependency matrix} has 
%     as first index a \word{network 2} output index, as second index 
%     a \word{network 2} input index, and the entries are |1| if 
%     there is a dependency between these items and |0| otherwise.
%     
%     The \word{queue-var} is the name of a variable in the calling 
%     context, where edges in \word{network 2} which go outside the 
%     current \word{site} are collected. An item in this queue is a 
%     list
%     \begin{quote}
%       \word{edge} \word{vertex} \word{side}
%     \end{quote}
%     where \word{edge} is the label of the edge in \word{network 2}. 
%     The \word{vertex} is the label of the vertex in \word{network 
%     2} which must be assigned to something before the expansion can 
%     continue, and \word{side} is |0| or |1| depending on which side 
%     of the \word{side} this assignment must happen: |0| means the 
%     output side and |1| means the input side. Elements that had 
%     been added to the \word{queue-var} are not removed even if an 
%     empty list is returned.
%     
%     The |ambiguities,expand| procedure itself also uses a |queue|, 
%     but here there can be three types of elements
%     \begin{quote}
%       |vertex| \word{site vertex} \word{2-vertex}\\
%       |inleg| \word{site edge} \word{2-input-index}\\
%       |outleg| \word{site edge} \word{2-output-index}
%     \end{quote}
%     |vertex| elements are for searches within the part of the site 
%     for which a correspondence is being established, whereas 
%     |inleg| and |outleg| elements are generated when a boundary of 
%     \word{network 2} is reached. These are used to check that the 
%     site and its correspondence are consistent with the 
%     dependencies allowed in \word{network 2}.
%     
%     For the purpose of checking dependencies, array mappings |IN| 
%     and |OUT| from edge label to leg index are set up for the 
%     edges known to correspond to inputs and outputs of 
%     \word{network 2}. |IN| and |OUT| get more entries when

%   The main |ambiguities| procedure is quite similar to the main 
%   |instances| procedure in that there is a |stack| of possibilities 
%   not explored yet and a variable |res| that collects all good 
%   results that have been found. A complication is however that there 
%   in this case also is a queue of edges to continue beyond the 
%   current boundary, and that processing queue elements may involve 
%   making choices. The solution used is that each stack element 
%   contains a queue, and that in each iteration of the main loop one 
%   element in the queue of one stack element is processed. The stack 
%   elements therefore have the form
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{next-vertex} \word{queue} \word{site}
%   \end{quote}
%   where the \word{next-vertex} is the label of the next vertex in 
%   \word{network 2} to seek an assignment for, if the \word{queue} is 
%   empty. The \word{queue} contains |edgefw| and |edgebw| elements as 
%   generated by |ambiguities,expand|.
%   
%   An easy step to start with is to compute the \word{dependency 
%   matrix} for the |expand| helper.

%   A simplification compared to the |instances| procedure is that the

%   inputs and outputs, which are used when adding feedbacks between 
%   these and the stray \word{network 2} edges. |i2L| and |o2L| are

%   Queues are traditionally processed in a FIFO order, but it is 
%   instructive to pause a moment and consider also the alterantive 
%   of processing |queue| in a LIFO order\Dash what difference would 
%   that make? The choice is primarily one between exploring the part 
%   of \word{network 2} not overlapping with \word{network 1} in a 
%   breadth-first or depth-first order, which corresponds to working 
%   with sites of high or low connectivity; breadth-first is never 
%   at a distance more than two from a fully connected site, whereas 
%   depth-first may follow a hamiltonian path to end without ever 
%   worrying about chords on that path. Since the overall process is 
%   a search through a space with many choices and many dead ends, it 
%   is important to quickly discover when things aren't working out. 
%   Low connectivity would also being about a large number of 
%   feedbacks, which affects many helpers negatively.
%   
%   When there is a queue element to process, one should thus pick 
%   the first element and remove it from the queue. If the 
%   \word{vertex} of that queue element is already assigned then a 
%   connection attempt can be made immediately, but otherwise it 
%   becomes necessary to also choose an assignment for the vertex.
%   \begin{tcl}

%   Assignment of edges is pretty similar whether it is done on the 
%   input or the output \word{side}; there are only a few list 
%   indices that differ in the initial checks of the prospective 
%   target vertex. Hence the two \word{side} cases are integrated. A 
%   second connection attempt is made immedaitely after an assignment

%   \begin{tcl}

%   \end{tcl}
%   There is also the important possibility that the vertex to assign 
%   does not correspond to anything in the \word{site}. In that case,

%   \end{tcl}
%   There is a possibility for speeding up the above by not in

%   in the |connect| is made. This would however require separate 
%   versions of |extend| for different \word{side}s (and the 
%   undirected version would still be needed below), so the code is 
%   more compact this way.
%   
%   When the |queue| is empty, one must look at the |nextvertex|. 
%   The case most similar to the above is that a \word{network 2} 
%   vertex is found which is not yet assigned because it is in a 
%   different component than anything which had previously been 
%   assigned.
%   \begin{tcl}

%   But when there isn't another vertex, then the assignment is 
%   complete; all that remains is to extract the \word{ambiguity} 
%   from the \word{site}. The case that there isn't any overlap 
%   between the two networks may however be skipped, as that is 
%   just a montage ambiguity.

%   The network with feedback part of an ambiguity is apparent in the

%   These are rebuilt as |E|, |outL|, and |inL|, while lists |Emap|, 
%   |outLmap|, and |inLmap| which map indices in these lists to their

%   temporarily maps to |-1|, but the final value is given for these 
%   as well (it can't be looked up immediately since the other half

%   networks returned to make them tidier in the sense hopefully not 
%   requiring as many crossings. What is altered is the order of

%   
%   A second difference is that this procedure makes sure to call 
%   |ambiguities| with the larger network as the first one, since this 
%   will probably make it run faster.

%   The grooming algorithm uses the same basic mechanisms as 
%   |order_graded_components|, but it doesn't bother about making the 
%   grading aestethically pleasing; all that sought is an ordering 
%   of the legs. 
%   
%   A technical complication is that there has to be something to 
%   order between vertices |0| and |1| in order to get the input leg 
%   ordering consistent with the output leg ordering. This is only 
%   a problem in the degenerate case that the input and output 
%   vertices are adjacent and at levels $1$ and $0$, but it 
%   nonetheless needs to be delt with. The chosen method is to insert 
%   an artificial level $1$ which is all edges. The |l| variable holds 
%   the index of the level below the input vertex.
%   \begin{tcl}
      set grading [${nspure}::minimal_grading [lindex $amb 0 0]]
      set l [lsearch -glob $grading {*{vertex 1}*}]

%   The orderings of legs from the argument networks are provided as

% \begin{proc}[]{verified_ambiguities}
%   This procedure is a helper for testing 
%   |network::wfb::ambiguities| and its |groomed_| persona. 
%   It has the same syntax as that main procedure and calls it, but 
%   then it checks the returned ambiguities to make sure that the two 
%   specified regions really are isomorphic to the given arguments and 
%   that the regions are instances of these networks. If a descripancy 
%   is found, then a detailed description is written to |stdout|, but 
%   no error is thrown.
%   
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |verified_ambiguities| \word{network 1} \word{network 2} 
%     |-signatures|\regopt
%   \end{quote}
%   Without the |-signatures| option, the result is the actual list of 
%   ambiguities. With the |-signatures| option, the result is instead 
%   a sorted dictionary of the signatures of the ambiguities, where a 
%   signature is a list
%   \begin{quote}
%     \word{\# vertices} \word{\# edges} \word{\# outputs}
%     \word{\# inputs} \word{\# feedbacks} \word{\# cuts in 1}
%     \word{\# cuts in 2}
%   \end{quote}
%   and the dictionary maps signatures to counts of that signature.
%   The list of signatures is sorted using |lsort -dictionary|. The 
%   ``\# of cuts'' refers to edges in the ambiguity which are cut up 
%   into pieces by the corresponding region.
%   
%   \begin{variable}{ambiguities_to_verify}

% \section{Enriched networks}
% 
% While the pure networks of the previous section capture the essence 
% of a graphic \PROP\ expression, there is a lot of useful information 
% that one might want to store with networks which however cannot fit 
% in this simple definition. Rich networks provides a framework within 
% which one may store such additional information, without causing 
% problems for the algebraic processing of networks.
% 
% \begin{tcl}
namespace eval network::rich {}
% \end{tcl}
% \setnamespace{network::rich}
% 
% The general framework is that an enriched network is a dictionary, 
% where each entry contains some particular kind of information about 
% the whole. The central part is the 
% \describestring[rich entry]{pure}|pure| entry, which is the pure 
% network that the other entries enrich. Many other entries reuse 
% labels in this network as indices, which means renumbering the |pure| 
% entry in a rich network in general requires corresponding changes 
% also in many other entries.
% 
% Many procedures operating on rich networks can do so both by value 
% and by reference. When they operate by value, they take the network 
% as argument and return a modified network. When they operate by 
% reference, they instead require the network to have been unrolled 
% into an array in the calling context and modify the contents of 
% this array directly. When such procedures accept a variable number 
% of options and values, a common pattern is that there are two 
% options
% \begin{ttdescription}
%   \item{-val} 
%     The rich network to set vertex positions in. If this 
%     option is provided and the command updates the network in some 
%     way, then the return value will be the updated network.
%   \item{-var} 
%     The name of an array in the calling context into 
%     which the rich network has been unrolled. If |-val| is not 
%     given then |-var| must be. Any modifications of the network will 
%     be performed directly in the array and there is probably no 
%     particular return value.
% \end{ttdescription}
% 
% One very useful entry is that which keeps track of vertex positions 
% for the purpose of drawing the network. The entry in question is 
% called |vpos-Tk|, and is a list of coordinate pairs with one pair 
% per vertex. The suffix |-Tk| is a hint that the coordinate system 
% used is that of the Tk |canvas| (i.e., the positive $y$ axis points 
% downwards).
% 
% A similar entry is 
% \describestring[rich entry]{ecurve-Tk-tt}|ecurve-Tk-tt|, which 
% contains coordinates for the edges as a Tk canvas |line| item with 
% |-smooth true| settings. The entry itself is a list with one element 
% per edge (indexed by edge label) and each element is the actual list 
% of coordinates. Alternatively, an 
% \describestring+[rich entry]{ecurve-Tk-raw} entry coordinates for the 
% edges as a Tk canvas |line| item with |-smooth raw| settings (i.e., 
% in terms of cubic curves). The curves need not be equivalent if 
% both entries are present, but both should work for the given vertex 
% positions.
% 
% Of more technical importance is the 
% \describestring[rich entry]{canonical}|canonical| entry. If present, 
% then this is a cache of the canonical form of the |pure| network, to 
% be used as a unique identifier.
% 
% A late addition is the \describestring+[rich entry]{bbox-Tk} entry, 
% which (if set) holds the (nominal) bounding box of the network. 
% This is needed since many drawing targets indirectly require the 
% user to provide this information!
% \changes{2.4}{2009/05/22}{Introducing \texttt{bbox-Tk} entry. 
%   Refactoring code accordingly. (LH)}
% 
% Two things that are \emph{not} put into rich networks are 
% corresponding feedback-lists and information about the graphical 
% representations of vertex types. The reason for this is that these 
% are typically properties that are common for several rich networks 
% and therefore belong at a higher level; if they were to be changed, 
% it is important that the change takes effect simultaneously for all 
% networks in a collection.
% 
% 
% \subsection{Drawing networks}
% 
% The \describestring[rich entry]{vpos-Tk}|vpos-Tk| entry of a rich 
% network holds one coordinate for each vertex. The entry is a list 
% indexed by vertex label and the elements are pairs of Tk $x$- and 
% $y$-coordinates. Canvas coordinates with units are not supported, 
% due to the arithmetic difficulties this would produce.
% 
% The \emph{appearence} of a vertex is determined by its decoration, 
% using information supplied in a separate table. The entries in this 
% table are lists
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{vertex-items} \word{output-offsets} \word{input-offsets}
% \end{quote}
% where the \word{vertex-items} is a list
% \begin{quote}
%   \begin{regblock}[\regplus]\word{item-type} 
%   \word{coordinates-command} \word{options}\end{regblock}
% \end{quote}
% where each triplet specifies one canvas item drawn for this vertex.
% The \word{item-type} is a canvas item type, \word{options} is a 
% list of item options (and pseudooptions) to apply to that item, and 
% \word{coordinates-command} is a command prefix that, when given 
% the position of the vertex as two additional arguments, returns the 
% list of coordinates needed for the canvas item. More precisely the 
% syntax is
% \begin{quote}
%   \meta{coordinates-command} \word{x} \word{y}
% \end{quote}
% where the \meta{coordinates-command} of course may be more than one 
% word. This command is furthermore evaluated in the |network::shape| 
% namespace, which makes it possible to omit namespace qualifiers for 
% commands in that namespace.
% \begin{tcl}
namespace eval network::shape {}
% \end{tcl}
% 
% \begin{proc}[network::shape]{square}
%   The |square| procedure has the syntax
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::shape::square| \word{half-side} \word{x} \word{y}
%   \end{quote}
%   It returns a list of four numbers, giving the coordinates of two 
%   diagonally opposed corners of a square with center at $(x,y)$ and 
%   whose side is twice the \word{half-side}.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::shape::square {r x y} {
   list [expr {$x - $r}] [expr {$y - $r}] [expr {$x + $r}]\
     [expr {$y + $r}]
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% \begin{proc}[network::shape]{offsets}
%   The |offsets| procedure has the syntax
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::shape::offsets| \word{offset-pair}\regstar\ ^^A
%     \word{x} \word{y}
%   \end{quote}
%   It returns a list of twice as many numbers as there are 
%   offset-pairs, where each pair of numbers is a sum of $(x,y)$ and 
%   an offset-pair.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::shape::offsets {args} {
   set x [lindex $args end-1]
   set y [lindex $args end]
   set res {}
   foreach pair [lrange $args 0 end-2] {
      lappend res [expr {$x + [lindex $pair 0]}]\
        [expr {$y + [lindex $pair 1]}]
   }
   return $res
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% In general, proper item options begin with a minus (|-|), so all 
% options that don't are assumed to be pseudooptions. The only 
% pseudooption defined so far is 
% \describestring+[pseudooption]{colourable}, which controls how 
% colour is applied to a vertex. The format of this option is a 
% dictionary of options and values, which specifies the default state 
% for the corresponding item (typically |-fill black| or 
% |-outline black|, but this is very item-dependent). When the item 
% is coloured, all these option values are instead set to the target 
% colour.
% 
% \begin{proc}{drawit}
%   The |drawit| procedure draws a network in a canvas (or reasonable 
%   simulation). The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::rich::drawit| \word{canvas-cmd} 
%     \word{appearance-dict} \word{tag-list} 
%     \begin{regblock}[\regplus]\word{option} 
%     \word{value}\end{regblock}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{canvas-cmd} is a command prefix that behaves like a 
%   Tk |canvas| and \word{appearance-dict} is a dictionary that maps 
%   vertex annotations to vertex appearances.
%   
%   The \word{tag-list} is a list of tags that are given to all 
%   canvas items representing parts of the network. In addition, the 
%   tag |vertex|\meta{n} is given to everything that is part of 
%   vertex $n$, the tag |edge|\meta{n} is given to everything that is 
%   part of edge $n$ (currently only one |line| item), and the tag 
%   |part|\meta{n} (where $n$ starts at $0$) is given to the $n$th 
%   canvas item for a particular vertex. These tags are used to 
%   manage updates of positions of items in the network.
%   
%   The available options are
%   \begin{ttdescription}
%     \item[-val] Standard pass-network-by-value option.
%     \item[-var] Standard pass-network-by-variable option.
%     \item[-update]
%       Takes a boolean value, defaults to |0|. If true, all items in 
%       the network are assumed to already exist, and only their 
%       coordinates and options should be updated. If false, create 
%       new canvas items for everything.
%     \item[-origin]
%       Takes a pair of numbers, defaults to |0 0|. The value is the 
%       position in the canvas's coordinate system of the origin of 
%       the network's coordinate system. This option can be used to 
%       graphically offset the network, in particular for situations 
%       where several networks are drawn into the same canvas.
%     \item[-region]
%       Takes as value a region which should be highlighted in the 
%       drawing. Defaults to `|{} {} {}|', i.e., the empty region.
%     \item[-incolour]
%       The colour to use for edges on the in-boundary of the region; 
%       defaults to |blue|.
%     \item[-outcolour]
%       The colour to use for edges on the out-boundary of the region; 
%       defaults to |red|.
%     \item[-midcolour]
%       The colour to use for vertices, internal edges, and in\&out 
%       edges of the region; defaults to |green|.
%   \end{ttdescription}
%   The network specified through the |-val| or |-var| option must

% \begin{proc}{draw_feedbacks}
%   This procedure is not really specific to rich networks, but it is

%     \begin{regblock}[\regplus]\word{option}

%   \end{quote}
%   and what it does is that it uses the specified \word{canvas-cmd} 
%   to draw feedbacks for a network, whose exact geometry depends 
%   on the options. These are:
%   \begin{ttdescription}
%     \item[-outx]
%       A list of $x$-coordinates for the outputs of the network. 
%       This option must be given.
%     \item[-inx]
%       A list of $x$-coordinates for the inputs of the network. 
%       This option must be given.
%     \item[-bbox]
%       A bounding box for the network, used for determining where 
%       the feedbacks may be drawn: below, to the left of, and above 
%       this box. If this option is not given the |bbox| subcommand 
%       of the \word{canvas-cmd} will be used to return the relevant 
%       data.
%     \item[-origin]
%       The canvas coordinates for the origin of the network 
%       coordinate system. All options above specify data in the 
%       network coordinate system. Defaults to |0 0|.
%     \item[-style]
%       List of options and values for the |line| items drawn for the 
%       feedbacks. Defaults to |-dash -| (dashed line). An alternative 
%       might be |-fill #888| (grey line).
%     \item[-legsep]
%       Typical distance (horizontally and vertically) between two 
%       legs. Defaults to $8$.
%     \item[-margin]
%       Distance between |-bbox| and innermost feedback leg. Defaults 
%       to double the |-legsep|.
%     \item[-outermargin]
%       Distance between outermost feedback leg and reported bounding 
%       box. Defaults to half the |-legsep|.
%   \end{ttdescription}
%   The return value is a bounding box for the material drawn.
%   
%   A feedback consists of three parts: (i)~an outleg part, which goes 
%   from the end of the out-leg to a point to the left of the 
%   network; (ii)~a switching part, which appears to the left of the 
%   network and goes from the bottom side to the top side; and 
%   (iii)~an inleg part, which goes from a point to the left of the 
%   network to the end of the in-leg. Lines may only cross in the 
%   switching part.
%   The items created get the tags in |tagL| and the additional tag 
%   |feedback|. The parts that correspond to one particular leg also 
%   get the additional tag |in|\meta{$k$} or |out|\meta{$k$} as 
%   appropriate.
%   
%   Initially, there is quite a lot of argument processing to handle 
%   all the options and their defaults.

% \begin{proc}{draw_brackets}
%   This is another procedure that doesn't mention rich networks in 
%   any way but still constitutes a natural partner of |drawit|. It 
%   is typically used to draw brackets around a network to package it 
%   as an item that can be used in a formula.
%   
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |network::rich::draw_brackets| \word{canvas-cmd} \word{tags}
%     \begin{regblock}[\regstar]\word{option} 
%     \word{value}\end{regblock}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{canvas-cmd} is a command prefix (with the same 
%   interface as a canvas) that will be used to do the actual 
%   drawing. \word{tags} is a list of tags that will be given to the 
%   items drawn, in addition the fixed tag |bracket|. The 
%   \word{option}s supported are
%   \begin{ttdescription}
%     \item[-bbox]
%       The bounding box of the items to bracket. If this option is 
%       omitted, then the |bbox| subcommand of \word{canvas-cmd} is 
%       used to obtain this information.
%     \item[-inch]
%       The length of a nominal inch, in the coordinate system of the 
%       \word{canvas-cmd}; this affects how thick the bracket stems 
%       should be. The default value is $72.0$. In the case of a Tk 
%       canvas, |[winfo fpixels |\word{canvas}| 1i]| computes the 
%       right value.
%     \item[-blacker]
%       A number of pixels (typically between $0$ and $1$) by which 
%       the width of stems should be increased before rounding. 
%       Defaults to $0.0$.
%     \item[-delimitershortfall]
%       This is how much shorter than the bounding box the brackets 
%       may be. The value is given in \TeX\ points (see below) and 
%       should be \emph{negative} if you want the brackets to be 
%       taller than the network. The default is $-5.0$. [Check 
%       appearance]
%     \item[-delimiterfactor]
%       This is a lower bound on the height of the brackets in the 
%       unit of the height of the bounding box. For historical 
%       reasons, the default is $0.901$.
%     \item[-operation]
%       This option controls which operation is performed. It 
%       defaults to |draw|, which means actually draw the brackets, 
%       but it can also be |width| or |bbox|, in which case nothing 
%       is drawn but the size of the brackes are determined. In the 
%       case of the |width| operation, the return value is also 
%       changed to be the width (in \word{canvas-cmd} units) of one 
%       of the brackets that would have been drawn. This can be used 
%       to determine how much space to reserve for the backets before 
%       positioning that which the brackets should surround.
%       \changes{2.3}{2009/03/29}{Added \texttt{bbox} operation. (LH)}
%   \end{ttdescription}
%   The return value is the bounding box of the brackets, which is 
%   not tight; bounding boxes for adjacent items should probably 
%   be set to touch this bounding box.
%   
%   The appearance of the brackets closely follows the \TeX\ font 
%   \texttt{cmex10}~\cite{CMfonts}\Ldash even down to the 
%   discretisation adjustments\Dash and size of the brackets is 
%   chosen as \TeX's |\left| and |\right| primitives would (except 
%   the normal size brackets are not considered, as they reside in a 
%   different font). In particular this means that many quantities 
%   have \TeX\ points ($1/72.27$ inches) as units rather than pixels, 
%   and following the MetaFont tradition these have names ending in 
%   |#|~(sharp). Some variable names even end in |.u#|, which means 
%   the quantity is a multiple of the basic design unit \(u\SH = 
%   20/36\,\mathrm{pt}\); it's easier to introduce this factor in a 
%   calculation than to incorporate it in a constant list of values.
%   
%   Variable names below often have curious names to reflect 
%   their MetaFont origin. 
%   The main unit for this part of the design is |dh#|, 
%   which is specified as ``60\% of the design size'', i.e., 
%   $6\,\mathrm{pt}$.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::rich::draw_brackets {canvasCmd tagL args} {
   array set Opt {-inch 72.0  -delimitershortfall -5.0 \
     -delimiterfactor 0.901  -blacker 0.0  -operation draw}
   array set Opt $args
   if {![info exists Opt(-bbox)]} then {
      set Opt(-bbox) [uplevel 1 [linsert $canvasCmd end bbox\
        [join $tagL &&]]]
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   The first part selects the bracket size, which is one of |\big|, 
%   |\Big|, |\bigg|, |\Bigg|, or extensible. |bh#| is the nominal 
%   height of the bracket character. |bw.u#| is the basic width of a 
%   bracket character. |aw.u#| is additional leading added (using 
%   \textbf{adjust\_fit}) to the outer side of the bracket. |th| is 
%   a parameter determining the thickness of the bracket by 
%   linearly interpolating between $\mathit{rule\_thickness}$ and 
%   $\mathit{stem}$.
%   \begin{tcl}
   foreach {left top right bottom} $Opt(-bbox) break
   set hppp [expr {$Opt(-inch)/72.27}]
   set h# [expr {($bottom - $top)/$hppp}]
   foreach bh# {12 18 24 30 infinity} \

         aw.u# {1.5 2 2.5 3 4} \
            th {0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1} {
      if {${bh#} >= ${h#} - $Opt(-delimitershortfall) && \
          ${bh#} >= ${h#} * $Opt(-delimiterfactor)} then {break}
   }
   if {${bh#} eq "infinity"} then {
      set bh# [expr {${h#} - $Opt(-delimitershortfall)}]
      if {${bh#} < ${h#} * $Opt(-delimiterfactor)} then {
         set bh# [expr {${h#} * $Opt(-delimiterfactor)}]
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Now we get to the pixel measurements, which are what the return 
%   value is all about. To that end, it is useful to make a list of 
%   font parameters and their values.
%   \begin{longtable}{r@{${}={}$}l}
%     \textit{letter\_fit}\SH& $0$\,pt\\
%     \textit{letter\_fit}& $0$\\
%     \textit{shrink\_fit}& $1$
%   \end{longtable}
%   \textit{shrink\_fit} is a rather curious parameeter, which behind 
%   the scenes is subtracted from the glyph pixel width while the 
%   glyph is being drawn, and then added back before the glyph is 
%   shipped out. Anyhow, these are what affect the width, so we now 
%   know enough to handle the |width| operation. Since the right 
%   bracket has its $x$ origin in a known position (|right|), it is 
%   easier to get actual coordinates for this glyph and then mirror 
%   them when drawing the left bracket.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set r [expr {round((${aw.u#}+${bw.u#})*20/36.0*$hppp)}]
   if {$Opt(-operation) eq "width"} then {return $r}
   set w [expr {$r - round(${aw.u#}*20/36.0*$hppp) - 1}]
   set u [expr {$w/${bw.u#}}]
%   \end{tcl}
%   In the MetaFont program, the \textit{shrink\_fit} is subtracted 
%   already from $r$ (and then added back at the very end), but since 
%   the value of $r$ anyway isn't used until it is time to determine 
%   the width, it can be left in a ``pure'' state. The calculation of 
%   $u$ can be found in the \textbf{do\_expansion} macro, which is 
%   called from \textbf{adjust\_fit}.
%   
%   Next comes the calculation of the bracket thickness. This is 
%   determined by a couple of additional parameters:
%   \begin{longtable}{r@{${}={}$}l}
%     \textit{rule\_thickness}\SH& $0.4$\,pt\\
%     \textit{rule\_thickness}& $\lceil 0.4 \mathit{hppp}\rceil$\\
%     \textit{stem}\SH& $25/36$\,pt\\
%     \textit{stem}& $[\mathit{stem}\SH \cdot \mathit{hppp} + 
%       \mathit{blacker}]$
%   \end{longtable}
%   At typical screen resolutions, both of them will be $1$, which 
%   means the bracket thickness is independent of the size, but the 
%   extra complexity doesn't hurt much.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set thickness [expr { round(
      (1-$th)*ceil(0.4*$hppp) +
      $th*round($hppp*25/36.0 + $Opt(-blacker))
   )}]
%   \end{tcl}
%   There are three $x$-coordinates which are relevant: $x_{1r}$ 
%   (outer side of bracket), $x_{1l}$ (inner side of bracket), and 
%   $x_4$ (end of tips).
%   \begin{tcl}
   set x1r [expr {round($w - 2.5*$u + 0.5*$thickness)}]
   set x1l [expr {$x1r - $thickness}]
   set x4  [expr {round(0.75*$u - 0.5*$thickness)}]
%   \end{tcl}
%   The relevant $y$-coordinates are $y_1$ (top), $y_2$ (bottom), 
%   $y_{4l}$ (inner side of top tip), and $y_{6r}$ (inner side of 
%   bottom tip). Exact rounding of these would be rather complicated, 
%   since it involves also sharp calculations made in \TeX\ and 
%   rounding in the DVI viewer. What I do here is that I find the 
%   sharp top and bottom positions for the bracket and then round 
%   them separately. The separate rounding happens also in the 
%   MetaFont case, but the integer coordinates to which one rounds 
%   need not reside in the same places. One feature of the MetaFont 
%   code that has been kept is that the bracket is shrunk by one 
%   pixel at the bottom side.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set mid [expr {0.5*($top+$bottom)}]
   set y1 [expr {round($mid - 0.5*${bh#}*$hppp)}]
   set y2 [expr {round($mid + 0.5*${bh#}*$hppp) - 1}]
   set y4l [expr {$y1 + $thickness}]
   set y6r [expr {$y2 - $thickness}]
%   \end{tcl}
%   The actual drawing is done by \textbf{fill}ing a |polygon|, 
%   unlike the MetaFont code which \textbf{filldraw}s three strokes. 
%   The reasons for this change are (i)~that it's actually possible 
%   to specify the outline in this case, as the pen has size $0$, and 
%   (ii)~that restrictions in the |canvas| make it impossible to 
%   position lines with more than pixel precision anyway (an odd 
%   width line conceptually fills half pixels at the sides).
%   \begin{tcl}

% \begin{proc}{drawit_bracketed}
%   This is a conveniency wrapper around the |drawit| and 
%   |draw_brackets| procedures, which additionally provides the 
%   feature of anchoring the drawn material to a point, thus making 
%   the origin of the network's own coordinate system irrelevant. The

%     |network::rich::drawit_bracketed| \word{canvas-cmd} 
%     \word{appearance-dict} \word{x} \word{y} 
%     \begin{regblock}[\regstar]\word{option} 
%     \word{value}\end{regblock}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where the first two arguments are as for the |drawit| 
%   procedure, and \word{x} and \word{y} are the coordinates where 
%   the network should be drawn. The return value is the bounding 
%   box of the material that was drawn.
%   
%   \changes{2.3}{2009/03/29}{Command added. (LH)}

%   The primary options supported are:
%   \begin{ttdescription}
%     \item[-val] Standard pass-network-by-value option.
%     \item[-var] Standard pass-network-by-variable option.
%     \item[-bracket]
%       Should the network be bracketed (boolean)? Defaults to true.
%     \item[-anchor]
%       The anchoring position, i.e., where the given point $(x,y)$ 
%       should be relative to the network. This is like a standard Tk 
%       |-anchor| option, and can take the values |n|, |ne|, |e|, 
%       |se|, |s|, |sw|, |w|, |nw|, and |center|. It also takes the 
%       nonstandard value |origin| (default), in which case $(x,y)$ 
%       is at the origin of the network coordinate system.
%     \item[-uselayout]
%       This is a boolean and defaults to true. In that case, it 
%       specifies that the network bounding box can be taken from the 
%       |level-layout-Tk| entry rather than computed from the 
%       |vpos-Tk| and |ecurve-Tk-tt| entries, as would anyway be done 
%       if the |level-layout-Tk| entry is missing.
%     \item[-tags]
%       The list of tags to use; defaults to being empty.
%   \end{ttdescription}
%   Besides these, all options are passed on to the two underlying 
%   procedures, although some may be overridden (e.g.~|-var|, |-val|,

% \subsection{Level layout}
% \label{Ssec:Layout}
% 
% The level layout for networks is based on a decomposition of the 
% network into components and the components into levels, such as 
% that computed by |network::pure::graded_components|: all items in a 
% level are put side-by-side, different levels are stacked on top of 
% each others, and different components are put side-by-side. It is 
% expected that this will become the primary layout for networks, even 
% though the rich network data structure allows any number of 
% alternative layouts.
% 
% The description of a layout is kept in the
% \describestring[rich entry]{level-layout-Tk}|level-layout-Tk| entry 
% of a network. In overall appearance this is similar to a list of 
% graded components, but there are extra elements all over that encode 
% graphical information. The lowest level is a list
% \begin{quote}
%   \begin{regblock}[\regstar]\word{component} \word{bbox}\end{regblock}
% \end{quote}
% where the first \word{component} must contain all inputs and outputs, 
% but the order is otherwise arbitrary. A \word{bbox} is a list
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{left} \word{top} \word{right} \word{bottom}
% \end{quote}
% of the four Tk coordinates of the boundary of the \word{component}.
% 
% A \word{component} is a list
% \begin{quote}
%   \begin{regblock}[\regstar]\word{level} \word{y-pos} 
%   \word{half-height}\end{regblock}
% \end{quote}
% where \word{y-pos} is the $y$-coordinate for the corresponding 
% \word{level} and \word{half-height} is how far below and above this 
% position that the level is considered to extend (the extent is 
% presumed to be symmetrical). A \word{level} is a list of items, 
% which have one of the following two forms:
% \begin{quote}
%   |vertex| \word{label} \word{x-pos}\\
%   |edge| \word{label} \word{x-pos}
% \end{quote}
% The levels are ordered from output to input side of the network. The 
% first and last \word{level} of the first component corresponds to the 
% output and input vertices respectively, but the items in these levels 
% are |edge|s enumerating the corresponding legs. (This arrangement is 
% motivated by the special role of the output and input vertices as 
% mere placeholders: even though they exist internally, they should not 
% be included in presentations of networks.) Empty extremal levels in 
% components other than the first may be omitted, but they can also be 
% included and left empty.
% 
% \begin{variable}{level-layout-Tk_defaults}
%   The |make_level-layout-Tk| procedure that normally constructs the 
%   |level-layout-Tk| entry in a rich network takes a great variety of 
%   options. Defaults for many of these options are kept in the 
%   |level-layout-Tk_defaults| variable, which is a dictionary. This 
%   allows centralised configuration of graphical details without 
%   having to modify every piece of code which might need to call 
%   |make_level-layout-Tk|.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}
namespace eval network::rich {variable level-layout-Tk_defaults {
   -padx 10  -pady 16
%   \end{tcl}
%   Extra space inserted between items in a level and between levels, 
%   respectively. Half these amounts are also inserted at the edges 
%   of the network for the calculation of the bounding box, with the 
%   exception of |-pady| in the first component.
%   \begin{tcl}
   -edgew 5  -edgeh 10
%   \end{tcl}
%   The nominal width and height respectively of an edge in a level.
%   \begin{tcl}
   -vsizes {* {20 20}}
%   \end{tcl}
%   This option is a \word{vertex-sizes} lists, as explained below. 
%   It is not used by the classical procedures (which instead have a 
%   mandatory argument for this if they need it), but the experience 
%   so far has been that this default is never changed, so newer 
%   procedures will rather perfer to have an option for this.
%   \changes{2.7}{2012/05/14}{\texttt{-vsizes} default added. (LH)}
%   \begin{tcl}
   -haligncmd align_active_midpoints
%   \end{tcl}
%   This is a command prefix used to align levels horisontally. It 
%   has the call syntax
%   \begin{quote}
%     \meta{haligncmd} \word{pure network} \word{below-level} 
%     \word{above-level}
%   \end{quote}
%   where the last two arguments are preliminary levels in the 
%   \word{pure network} for which an alignment should be computed. 
%   The items in these levels have the slightly modified forms
%   \begin{quote}
%     |vertex| \word{label} \word{left} \word{right}\\
%     |edge| \word{label} \word{left} \word{right}
%   \end{quote}
%   where the \word{left} and \word{right} are preliminary 
%   $x$-coordinates for the left and right sides of the area reserved 
%   for the item; the final position is the average of these two 
%   positions. The return value is the number which should be added to 
%   the positions in the \word{above-level} to make that level line up 
%   with the \word{below-level}. The command name is resolved from 
%   within the |network::rich| namespace.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}
   -anchor nw
%   \end{tcl}
%   This is like a standard Tk |-anchor| option, and can take the 
%   values |n|, |ne|, |e|, |se|, |s|, |sw|, |w|, |nw|, and |center|. 
%   These points are relative to the bounding box of the entire 
%   network, and what is specified is the point which will be at 
%   coordinates $(0,0)$. The default |nw| is to make it maximally 
%   likely that the network is visible if drawn in a nonscrolled 
%   canvas.
%   
%   The |-seqcmd| option is by default not initialised. This is, as in 
%   |network:|\discretionary{}{}{}|:pure:|\discretionary{}{}{}^^A
%   |:order_graded_components|, the command prefix used to find an 
%   ordering of items within a level. Not giving a value for this 
%   means to use the default of |order_graded_components|.

%   The procedure is basically a conveniency wrapper around the three

%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{below-level} and \word{above-level} have the format 
%   described with the |-haligncmd| option above.
%   The idea is to compute for each level the interval on the 
%   $x$-axis in which there are items which connect to the other 
%   level, and then align the midpoints of these intervals.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}

% 
% \begin{proc}{make_level-layout-Tk}
%   This procedure constructs a |level-layout-Tk| entry, and also a

%   and extra data provided through options. The call syntax is

%   \begin{quote}
%     \begin{regblock}[\regplus]\word{pattern} \word{size}\end{regblock}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{pattern} is a |string match| pattern to match against a 
%   vertex annotation and \word{size} is a pair of width and height for 
%   vertices with such annotations. A match is sought from start to 
%   end; it is an error if no match is found.
%   
%   The available \word{option}s, in addition to those documented 
%   with the |level-layout-Tk_defaults| above, are:
%   \begin{ttdescription}
%     \item[-val] Standard pass-network-by-value option.
%     \item[-var] Standard pass-network-by-variable option.
%     \item[-levellist]
%       If specified, this is a list indexed by vertex labels, giving 
%       the level (counting from $0$ at the output) of each vertex. 
%       If not given, |graded_components| uses its default for this.
%       The level of the input vertex must be larger than the level 
%       of any other vertex in its component, similarly the level of 
%       the output vertex must be lower than that of any other vertex.
%     \item[-componentlist]
%       If specified, this is a list of components, where each 
%       component is an flat list of items (i.e., there is no level 
%       grading). If not given, |graded_components| uses its default 
%       for this.
%     \item[-prehints]
%       Early hints for relative order of items (`|vertex |$v$', 
%       `|edge |$e$~\textit{level}').
%     \item[-prehints]

%   The basic approach for the curve segments is to use the MetaFont

%   is computed by the |MetaFont_controls| helper procedure.

%   
%   Internal edges have one curve segment more than they got 
%   pass-through levels (i.e., triplets in their |Node| entry), so 
%   one can compute most segments in a loop over the |Node| entry, 
%   and then compute the final segment outside the loop. This is 
%   basically what is done, but a number of complications have to be 
%   dealt with:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item
%       Each |Node| entry contributes both to the end of the previous 
%       segment and to the beginning of the next, so it is necessary 
%       to remember some data (|x0|, |y0|, and |ofs0|) from the 
%       previous iteration. This data is initialised according to the 
%       head vertex, and the extra segment uses data about the tail 
%       vertex.
%     \item
%       Between two segments, there is a straight line segment which 
%       is generated by repeating the last pair of coordinates from 
%       the previous curve segment and the first pair of coordinates 
%       from the next curve segment. However, that repetition should 
%       only take place when there was a previous curve segment (|L| 
%       is nonempty).
%     \item
%       When the head vertex is $0$ or the tail vertex is $1$, then 
%       the first or last respectively curve segment is missing, so 
%       it is necessary to check for those cases explicitly.

%   The two \word{offset-$k$} arguments are lists that contain most

%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where $(\Delta x,\Delta y)$ is the offset to the knot point 
%   $(x_k,y_k)$ from the \emph{reference point} $(X_k,Y_k)$. 
%   $(v_x,v_y)$ is a tangent vector (at the knot in question) to 
%   the curve segment; its length is irrelevant. The \word{atleast} 
%   argument is a boolean for whether the curve tension should be 
%   `atleast $1$' rather than just~$1$. The \word{no-$y$-stationary} 
%   argument is another boolean which causes the tensions to be 
%   increased to avoid stationary points for the $y$-component of the 
%   curve parametrisation.

% \subsection{Elastic edges}
% 
% [The following was first done in version 1 of the \textsf{network} 
% code, but ultimately the spring-type heuristics for networks turned 
% out to not be as good as folklore suggests they are for graphs\Dash 
% apparently it makes a considerable difference whether the edges 
% point in fixed directions or can rotate freely. The only thing that 
% the elastic model turned out to be noticably good at was finding a 
% nice shape for edges once the positions of vertices were known, so 
% I have kept that. The argument leading up to the procedure should 
% however still be of interest.]
% 
% The problem of automatically finding a nice way to draw a graph in 
% the plane has generated a substantial body of 
% literature~\cite{GraphDrawingBibl}, and it turns out that in most 
% cases the problem of finding the \emph{best} (with respect to some 
% reasonable criteria) way to draw a graph is NP-hard. 
% There are however plenty of useful heuristic methods around.
% 
% One of the most popular heuristics, originally due to Eades, is to 
% consider the graph as a physical system, where the edges are replaced by 
% springs and the vertex positions are chosen so that the system is in 
% equilibrium. Finding an equilibrium configuration is in general easy, 
% since a simulation (with some kind of ``friction'') of the system 
% will in general quickly approach and come to rest at some equilibrium. 
% As is often the case in graph theory, such physical models demonstrate 
% an unreasonable usefulness.
% 
% In the network situation, where edges are curves rather than straight 
% lines, it probably makes more sense to think of them as strings made 
% from some elastic material than to think of them as actual springs. 
% The physical law governing their behaviours would be the same in both 
% cases, but it is easier to justify the calculations below in a truly 
% continuous model.
% 
% The relevant physical law for elasticity in this case is \emph{Hooke's 
% law}
% \begin{equation} \label{Eq:Hooke}
%   \sigma = E \varepsilon 
%   \qquad\text{where}\qquad 
%   \varepsilon = \frac { \mathit{\Delta l} }{ l }
%   \text{,}
% \end{equation}
% which relates the tension $\sigma$ to the relative elongation 
% $\varepsilon$ of the string, via the \emph{elasticity coefficient} $E$ 
% of the material. However in this particular problem it is more 
% convenient to relate $\varepsilon$ to the amount of energy that is 
% stored in the string (or equivalently: the amount of energy it took 
% to deform the string), as reasoning about energy is often much simpler 
% than reasoning about forces. In this case the relevant formula is
% \begin{equation}
%   W = k \varepsilon^2
% \end{equation}
% as follows from \eqref{Eq:Hooke} by integration over $\mathit{\Delta l}$. 
% (The constant \(k = \frac{1}{2} EAl\), where $A$ is the cross-section 
% area of the string and the factor $\frac{1}{2}$ comes from the 
% integration.)
% 
% Since it is given that each edge will have the shape of a parametric 
% curve $\mathbf{r}(t)$ for \(t \in [t_1,t_2]\), it is close at hand to 
% adopt the parameter $t$ as being proportional to the natural length of 
% the string. In this case, $\varepsilon$ need not be constant along the 
% string, but varies with parametric speed so that \(\bigl( 1 +\nobreak 
% \varepsilon(t) \bigr) v_0 = v(t)\), where \(v(t) = \bigl\vert 
% \mathbf{v}(t) \bigr\vert\), \(\mathbf{v}(t) = \mathbf{r}'(t)\), and 
% $v_0$ is the parametric speed for the string at its natural length. 
% Consequently
% \begin{equation} \label{Eq:ElastiskEnergi}
%   W = k \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \varepsilon(t)^2 \,\mathit{dt} =
%   \frac{k}{v_0^2} \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \bigl( v(t) - v_0 \bigr)^2 
%   \,\mathit{dt}
% \end{equation}
% is the relevant quantity to consider.
% 
% As a first step, one may consider what shape the edges should assume 
% if endpoints and endpoint tangents are given. The answer is that they 
% should assume a shape with minimal energy, i.e., a shape for which 
% the integral
% \begin{equation} \label{Eq:Kant-energi}
%   \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \bigl( v(t) - v_0 \bigr)^2 \,\mathit{dt}
% \end{equation}
% is minimal. Since the edge curve $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is a |-smooth true| 
% canvas curve defined by four points $\mathbf{z}_0$, $\mathbf{z}_1$, 
% $\mathbf{z}_2$, and $\mathbf{z}_3$, it is most easily expressed in 
% terms of Bern\v{s}te\u{\i}n polynomials. For any \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) 
% and $a_0,\dotsc,a_n$ define
% \begin{equation}
%   B_n(a_0,\dotsc,a_n; t) =
%   \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (1-t)^{n-k} t^k a_k \text{.}
% \end{equation}
% Then by definition of |-smooth true| curves,
% \begin{equation*}
%   \mathbf{r}(t) = \begin{cases}
%     B_2( \mathbf{z}_0, \mathbf{z}_1, \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{z}_1 + 
%       \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{z}_2; t) &
%       \text{if \(0 \leqslant t \leqslant 1\),}\\
%     B_2( \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{z}_1 + \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{z}_2, 
%       \mathbf{z}_2, \mathbf{z}_3; t-1) &
%       \text{if \(1 \leqslant t \leqslant 2\).}
%   \end{cases}
% \end{equation*}
% In general,
% \begin{equation} \label{Eq:Bernstein-diff}
%    \frac{d}{\mathit{dt}} B_n(a_0,\dotsc,a_n; t) =
%    B_{n-1}(a_1-a_0,\dotsc,a_n-a_{n-1}; t)
% \end{equation}
% and consequently
% \begin{equation*}
%   \mathbf{v}(t) = \begin{cases}
%     2B_1( \mathbf{z}_1 - \mathbf{z}_0 , 
%       \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{z}_2 - \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{z}_1; t) &
%       \text{if \(0 \leqslant t \leqslant 1\),}\\
%     2B_1( \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{z}_2 - \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{z}_1, 
%       \mathbf{z}_3 - \mathbf{z}_2; t-1) &
%       \text{if \(1 \leqslant t \leqslant 2\).}
%   \end{cases}
% \end{equation*}
% Since
% \begin{multline*}
%   \bigl\vert B_1(\mathbf{a}_0,\mathbf{a}_1;t) \bigr\vert^2 =
%   \bigl< B_1(\mathbf{a}_0,\mathbf{a}_1;t), 
%     B_1(\mathbf{a}_0,\mathbf{a}_1;t) \bigr> = \\ =
%   \bigl< (1-t) \mathbf{a}_0, (1-t) \mathbf{a}_0 \bigr> + 
%     \bigl< (1-t) \mathbf{a}_0, t \mathbf{a}_1 \bigr> + 
%     \bigl< t \mathbf{a}_1, (1-t) \mathbf{a}_0 \bigr> + 
%     \bigl< t \mathbf{a}_1, t \mathbf{a}_1 \bigr> = \\ =
%   B_2\bigl( \lvert\mathbf{a}_0\rvert^2, 
%     \langle \mathbf{a}_0, \mathbf{a}_1\rangle, 
%     \lvert\mathbf{a}_1\rvert^2; t \bigr)
% \end{multline*}
% it follows that
% \begin{equation*}
%   v(t)^2 = \begin{cases}
%     4 B_2\Bigl( \lvert \mathbf{z}_1 - \mathbf{z}_0 \rvert^2, 
%       \tfrac{1}{2} \langle \mathbf{z}_1 - \mathbf{z}_0, 
%         \mathbf{z}_2 - \mathbf{z}_1 \rangle,
%       \tfrac{1}{4} \lvert \mathbf{z}_2 - \mathbf{z}_1 \rvert^2;

%       t-1 \Bigr) &
%       \text{if \(1 \leqslant t \leqslant 2\).}
%   \end{cases}
% \end{equation*}
% 
% From applying \eqref{Eq:Bernstein-diff} backwards one gets
% \begin{equation*}
%   \int B_n(a_0,\dotsc,a_n; t) \, \mathit{dt} =
%   \tfrac{1}{n+1} B_{n+1}( 0, a_0, a_0+a_1, \dotsc, a_0 + a_1 +

% and thus in particular

% Writing \(\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{z}_3 - \mathbf{z}_0\), \(r\mathbf{a} =

% \end{equation}
% 
% Thus far, things are pretty easy, but that is just one term of 
% \eqref{Eq:Kant-energi}. There is also a trivial term 
% \(\int_0^2 v_0^2\,\mathit{dt} = 2 v_0^2\) and a term

% which is rather difficult due to the square root. 
% 
% As a preparation for the problem with the shape of edges with positive

% 
% Certainly not 
% impossible---$v(t)^2$ is just a second degree polynomial in $t$, so 
% the primitive function of $v(t)$ can be expressed in terms of

% to program. Therefore I prefer to let \(v_0=0\) (certainly in 
% complete disregard of how \eqref{Eq:Kant-energi} was derived, but 
% since this is just a heuristic anyway, I can do whatever I bloody 
% want as long as I am satisfied with the results!), which corresponds 
% to giving the edges zero natural length. This is not a problem in 
% practice, since there will (besides the attraction from the edges) 
% also be repulsive forces between the vertices.\footnote{Obviously a 
% comment based on the expectation that forces along edges should be 
% modelled after forces in springs. This, as it turned out, was not a 
% very good idea.}

%     \word{min-coeff}\regopt
%   \end{quote}
%   where \word{network-var} and \word{type-arr} are names of variables 
%   in the local context of the caller. The \word{min-coeff}, which 
%   defaults to |0.6|, is a lower bound for the $r$ and $s$ 
%   coefficients which overrides the normal formula 
%   \eqref{Eq:Elastiska-rs}. There is no particular return 
%   value, but the \word{network-var} will be modified.
%   
%   Each edge curve is defined by four points. The two endpoints are 
%   precisely the points where the edge is attached to a vertex, or in 
%   the case of the input\slash output end of a leg, the cut-off point 
%   of that leg. The endpoint tangent lines go through the corresponding 
%   vertex, or in the case of legs, is vertical. This leaves only two 
%   degrees of freedom, for which the values are normally computed 
%   according to \eqref{Eq:Elastiska-rs}, but if either of these fall 
%   below the \word{min-coeff} then that number is used instead for 
%   that coefficient. The reason such a lower bound is useful is that 
%   the $r$ and $s$ computed by the above formulae may well be zero or 
%   negative, and in that case the edge curves would not begin in the 
%   intended direction.

% \subsection{SVG rendering}
% 
% As the complexity of networks and expressions involving networks 
% increases, the Tk |canvas| is getting less convenient as a drawing 
% vehicle; it lacks direct support for the higher level presentation 
% concerns (especially line breaking) that start to appear. 
% A rendering target which offers better support in that area is SVG, 
% as it can be embedded into XHTML.
% 
% Being an application of XML, it is convenient to return SVG code as a 
% \Tcl\ data-tree and then rely on e.g.~\textsf{tdom} to convert this 
% to standard XML code.
% A \emph{data-tree} is a rooted tree where the nodes carry a type-tag 
% and optionally attributes, the children of a node are ordered, and 
% (as a special case) strings may appear as children of a node. The 
% encoding of these follow the \textsf{tdom} ``list'' format for XML 
% nodes, i.e., a data-tree is either (i)~a three element list
% \begin{quote}
%   \word{tag} \word{attributes} \word{children}
% \end{quote}
% where \word{tag} is a string (which must be a valid XML name), 
% \word{attributes} is a dictionary (mapping attribute name to value), 
% and \word{children} is a list of data-trees, or a data-tree is (ii)~a 
% two element list
% \begin{quote}
%   |#text| \word{string}
% \end{quote}
% encoding the explicit string \word{string}.
% 
% Note that all \word{string}s and attribute values are \Tcl\ strings, 
% not XML encodings of such strings. This means the amperand character 
% is really `|&|', not `|&amp;|'. Also note that |#text| is not a valid 
% \word{tag}, since `|#|' is not allowed in XML names. This implies 
% that \textbf{data-trees can be processed directly using the 
% data-is-code technique}.
% 
% \begin{proc}{as_SVG}
%   The |as_SVG| procedure takes a rich network with |vpos-Tk| and 
%   |ecurve-Tk-tt| entries as argument, and returns the data-tree for 
%   an SVG drawing of the same. The call syntax is
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     |network::rich::as_SVG| \word{vertex-object dict} 
%     \begin{regblock}[\regplus] \word{option} \word{value} 
%     \end{regblock}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where the \word{vertex-object dict} maps vertex decorations to 
%   corresponding graphical appearances, as SVG data-trees with the 
%   reference point at $(0,0)$. The default XML namespace for these 
%   is that of SVG, and they occur once for each vertex (if sharing 
%   is wanted, then use |use| elements or similar for these).
%   
%   The available options are
%   \begin{ttdescription}
%     \item[-val] Standard pass-network-by-value option.
%     \item[-var] Standard pass-network-by-variable option.
%     \item[-class]
%       The value of the |class| attribute for the top-level |svg| 
%       element. Defaults to |network|. An empty string means the 
%       attribute is omitted.
%     \item[-setstroke]
%       Takes a boolean value, defaults to true. When true, the 
%       attributes |fill="none" stroke="currentColor"| are applied to 
%       the top-level SVG element, as that is the most practical 
%       default by virtue of being the same as in Tk. If these 
%       attributes are instead supplied through a class, then turning 
%       |-setstroke| off yields less code.
%       \changes{2.5}{2009/07/27}{Switching to stroking as default 
%          paint mode in SVG networks. (LH)}
%     \iffalse
%     \item[-region]
%       Takes as value a region which may be highlighted in the 
%       drawing. Defaults to `|{} {} {}|', i.e., the empty region.
%     \item[-incolour]
%       The colour to use for edges on the in-boundary of the region; 
%       defaults to |blue|.
%     \item[-outcolour]
%       The colour to use for edges on the out-boundary of the region; 
%       defaults to |red|.
%     \item[-midcolour]
%       The colour to use for vertices, internal edges, and in\&out 
%       edges of the region; defaults to |green|.

% \begin{proc}{_opts2paint}
%   The |_opts2paint| procedure converts |canvas| item options

%     |_opts2paint| \word{opts} \word{fill-is-stroke} 
%     \word{stroke-by-default}
%   \end{displaysyntax}

%   \begin{displaysyntax}

%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where \word{attributes} is the attribute dictionary and 
%   \word{remaining opts} is the key--value list of options that were 
%   not converted.
%   
%   The \word{stroke-by-default} argument is |1| if stroking is the 
%   default state for this item; this is true for most |canvas|

%   items (most notably |line|) that uses |-fill| rather than 
%   |-outline| for what would normally be considered a stroke.
%   
%   A difference between Tk and SVG is that most items on the Tk

%   This interpretation is bidi-ignorant, since the values |start|,

% \subsection{\LaTeX\ (PGF) rendering}
% 
% The basic approach for the \LaTeX\ rendering is to build on the PGF 
% package, since this provides better coverage of PS \emph{and} PDF 
% than anything else I've encountered. Unfortunately, raw PGF code is 
% rather verbose, so it seems a good idea to create a new frontend 
% that permits more compact code.
% 
%    \begin{macrocode}
%<*sdpgf>
\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}
\ProvidesPackage{sdpgf}[2011/01/24 Space-delimited PGF pictures]
\ProcessOptions
\RequirePackage{pgfcore}
\usepgfmodule{shapes}
%    \end{macrocode}
% 
% The characteristic trait of this frontend is that it uses \TeX\ 
% commands with \emph{space-delimited} arguments. First, this is more 
% compact than brace-delimiting (one delimiter character per argument 
% instead of two). Second, it permits ordinary text wrapping commands 
% to reflow the code; this can do wonders for reducing the number of 
% lines a picture takes to draw, and is thus also of great help for 
% keeping the code visually compact (without appearing rigid).
% 
% \begin{macro}{\sdpgfunit}
%   Another trait is that all coordinates are expressed as multiples 
%   of |\sdpgfunit| rather than as explicit lengths (which is the 
%   normal case in PGF). This saves at least two characters per 
%   coordinate (no \TeX\ unit is shorter than two characters) and 
%   gives a ``coordinate transformation'' scaling capability, which 
%   can be useful since the ``quick'' PGF commands used operate at 
%   the level below PGF's coordinate transformations.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newdimen\sdpgfunit
%    \end{macrocode}
%   By choosing the |\sdpgfunit| carefully, it can furthermore be 
%   possible to make all coordinates integers, which saves another 
%   character for the decimal point.
% \end{macro}
% 
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@x}
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@y}
%   A third trait is that many SDPGF commands use relative 
%   coordinates rather than absolute; again to squeeze another 
%   character or two from many arguments. Since PGF doesn't seem to 
%   provide an easy method of retrieving the coordinates of the 
%   current point however, it becomes necessary to allocate two extra 
%   registers to keep track of this within the frontend.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newdimen\SDPGF@x
\newdimen\SDPGF@y
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}\end{macro}
% 
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@@L}
%   An example of this is the |\L| command, which corresponds to PS's 
%   \textsf{rlineto} operator (except the arguments come after, since 
%   this is still \TeX).
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\SDPGF@@L #1 #2 {%
   \advance \SDPGF@x #1\sdpgfunit
   \advance \SDPGF@y #2\sdpgfunit
   \pgfpathqlineto{\the\SDPGF@x}{\the\SDPGF@y}%
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%   The commands are normally kept in control sequences with a 
%   |\SDPGF@@| prefix, and only switched to ``user'' names inside the 
%   \texttt{sdpgf} environment (see below).
% \end{macro}
% 
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@@m}
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@@M}
%   The current position is usually initialised using the |\m| 
%   command, which takes absolute coordinates (thus corresponding to 
%   PS's \textsf{moveto}). For completeness, there is also an |\M| 
%   command which takes relative coordinates (thus corresponding to 
%   PS's \textsf{rmoveto}).
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\SDPGF@@m #1 #2 {%
   \SDPGF@x=#1\sdpgfunit
   \SDPGF@y=#2\sdpgfunit
   \pgfpathqmoveto{\the\SDPGF@x}{\the\SDPGF@y}%
}
\def\SDPGF@@M #1 #2 {%
   \advance \SDPGF@x #1\sdpgfunit
   \advance \SDPGF@y #2\sdpgfunit
   \pgfpathqmoveto{\the\SDPGF@x}{\the\SDPGF@y}%
}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}\end{macro}
% 
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@@C}
%   The |\C| command corresponds to the Type~1 charstring 
%   \textsf{rrcurveto} command, i.e., the coordinates of each new 
%   point (whether control point or knot) are relative to those of 
%   the point before.
%   
%   This is slightly more complicated than the previous commands, 
%   because the control point coordinates needs to be saved away as 
%   tokens.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\SDPGF@@C #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 {%
   \advance \SDPGF@x #1\sdpgfunit
   \advance \SDPGF@y #2\sdpgfunit
   \edef\@tempa{{\the\SDPGF@x}{\the\SDPGF@y}}%
   \advance \SDPGF@x #3\sdpgfunit

   \advance \SDPGF@y #6\sdpgfunit
   \@tempa{\the\SDPGF@x}{\the\SDPGF@y}%
}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% 
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@@h}
%   As in PDF, the |\h| command closes the current path, but does not 
%   change the current point (just like its Type~1 charstring 
%   counterpart).
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\SDPGF@@h{\pgfsyssoftpath@closepath}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% 
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@@S}
%   Also as in PDF, the |\S| command strokes the current path without 
%   closing it first, i.e., it is an alias for |\pgfusepathqstroke|. 
%   Some experiments showed that occurrencies of |\pgfusepathqstroke| 
%   tended to account for a third of all characters in an image!
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\SDPGF@@S{\pgfusepathqstroke}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% 
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@@re}
%   The |\re| command constructs a rectangle, like the PDF operator 
%   \textsf{re}. It has the syntax
%   \begin{quote}
%     |\re| \meta{left} \meta{bottom} \meta{width} \meta{height}
%   \end{quote}
%   Implementation-wise, it maps directly to the 
%   |\pgfsyssoftpath@rect| command. It might be argued that it should 
%   also update |\SDPGF@x| and |\SDPGF@y|, but this didn't seem 
%   necessary.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\SDPGF@@re #1 #2 #3 #4 {%
   \pgfsyssoftpath@rect{#1\sdpgfunit}{#2\sdpgfunit}%
     {#3\sdpgfunit}{#4\sdpgfunit}%
}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% 
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@@ov}
%   The |\ov| (for `oval') command constructs an ellipse inscribed in 
%   and with axes parallel to the corresponding |\re| rectangle. It 
%   thus has the syntax
%   \begin{quote}
%     |\ov| \meta{min-x} \meta{min-y} \meta{width} \meta{height}
%   \end{quote}
%   although the two coordinates can technically be for any corner of 
%   the bounding box, if the signs of \meta{width} and \meta{height} 
%   are adjusted accordingly.

% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@@TR}
%   The |\TR| command creates a text node with \texttt{rectangle} 
%   shape and a particular anchoring at a particular point. The syntax 
%   is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |\TR| \meta{x} \meta{y} \meta{angle} \meta{anchor} 
%     \meta{label text}
%   \end{quote}
%   where \meta{anchor} and \meta{label text} are as for the 
%   |\pfgnode| command. Note that these arguments may well contain 
%   spaces themselves, so the caller must take care to brace them 
%   when necessary. The \meta{x} and \meta{y} arguments are 
%   coordinates in |\sdpgfunit|s, and the \meta{angle} is in degrees; 
%   use \texttt{0} for an ordinary horizontal baseline.
%   
%   The node path is always discarded. The coordinate transformation 
%   needed to put the node somewhere other than the origin is kept 
%   within a group.

%    \end{macrocode}
%   Having waded through a trace of this command, I must say I am 
%   sorely tempted to rewrite it in terms of |\pgfqbox| and\slash or 
%   |\pgfqboxsynced| instead\Dash there's simply no reason to put 
%   \TeX\ through all that just for this. On the other hand, it would 
%   make the \textsf{sdpgf} package quite a bit larger. An 
%   interesting compromise could be to implement a |\Tr| command that 
%   handles everything but rotation directly using |\pgfqbox| and 
%   \TeX\ box manuoevres\dots
% \end{macro}
% 
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@Fs}
% \begin{macro}{\SDPGF@FS}
%   The |\Fs| command is a compact alias for |\fontsize| (i.e., it 
%   sets the font size). The |\FS| command does the same, and in 
%   addition calls |\selectfont| to actually change the current font.
%   The  syntaxes are
%   \begin{quote}
%     |\Fs{|\meta{units or length}|}|\\
%     |\FS{|\meta{units or length}|}|
%   \end{quote}
%   since these command are typically used within a space-delimited 
%   \meta{label text}, and would therefore be impractical to delimit 
%   with spaces.
%   
%   The \meta{units \emph{or} length} part exploits a 
%   not-so-well-known feature of |\fontsize|, namely that it takes a 
%   \meta{dimen} as argument but will supply |pt| as default unit if 
%   none is given. |\Fs| and |\FS| does the same, but supplies 
%   |\sdpgfunit| as the default unit.
%   
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\SDPGF@@Fs#1{\fontsize{#1\sdpgfunit}\z@}
\def\SDPGF@@FS#1{\SDPGF@@Fs{#1}\selectfont}
%    \end{macrocode}
%   The reason it works to merely insert an |\sdpgfunit| like that is 
%   that |\fontsize| internally uses |\@defaultunits|, which causes 
%   everything after the first syntactically valid \meta{dimen} to be 
%   gobbled. It's a hack, but it works beautifully.
% \end{macro}\end{macro}
% 
% 
% \begin{environment}{sdpgf}
%   The |sdpgf| environment is a |pgfpicture| environment with some 
%   extra initialisation, particularly the switching-in of |\SDPGF@@| 
%   commands. The syntax is
%   \begin{quote}
%     |\begin{sdpgf}|\marg{left}\marg{top}\marg{right}\marg{bottom}^^A
%     \marg{unit}\\
%     \vadjust{}\quad\meta{graphics}\\
%     |\end{sdpgf}|
%   \end{quote}
%   where \meta{unit} (a length) is the |\sdpgfunit| value used in 
%   the environment. The \meta{left}, \meta{top}, \meta{right}, and 
%   \meta{bottom} (all factors) define the bounding box for the 
%   environment.
%   
%   The baseline of the picture is initialised so that the picture 
%   is positioned as if it had been |\vcenter|ed.
%   To that end, it is necessary to record the length of |-1ex| 
%   before the |\pgfpicture| command, as the latter apparently 
%   switches to |\nullfont|.
%    \begin{macrocode}

%   From the PGF manual, the kosher way of setting the bounding box 
%   seems to be to say \verb*"\pgfusepath{use as bounding box}", but 
%   the actual effect of that rather appears to be to turn 
%   bbox-checking \emph{off}! Any contribution to the bbox would come 
%   from the path construction phase, which in turn means quick paths 
%   are ignored\dots
%   
%   Some source-diving turned up four |\dimen| registers that 
%   actually keep track of the bounding box. Setting them directly is 
%   much easier, but apparently one has to do so globally.

%   The edges are drawn first, the vertices last. 
%   
%   The |-region| may cause edges to be subdivided, so the first step 
%   in processing it must be to figure out how many pieces there are 
%   of each edge. This information can be computed from the 
%   \word{output-list} and \word{input-list} of the region, but this 
%   is not straightforward as the extended labelling of edges applied 
%   in these lists only has separate labels for the pieces \emph{in} 
%   the region, leaving no room for labelling the pieces not in the 
%   region. The easist way of dealing with this seems to be to 
%   relabel the region legs so that each piece has its own label; 
%   that implies also computing lists |OL| and |IL| of region legs 
%   after relabelling.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set OL {}
   set IL {}
%   \end{tcl}
%   Recall that an extended label has the form $l+mi$, where $l$ is 
%   the underlying edge label, $m$ is the number of edges, and $i$ is 
%   the piece index. Making room for pieces between those that are in 
%   the region requires doubling the $i$ part, but there are two 
%   cases to consider. If the edge tail is in the region then a 
%   straight doubling \(i \mapsto 2i\) is correct, but if the edge 
%   tail is not in the region then one must make it \(i \mapsto 
%   2i+1\) where the extra $1$ is for the piece containing the tail. 
%   The cases where that extra $1$ should be added are precisely 
%   those where $l$ is in the \word{input-list}, since an input leg 
%   can only have \(i=0\) if it is the first region piece of the 
%   edge.
%   
%   It is convenient to also compute the multiplicities when doing 
%   this relabelling; the |multL| list is indexed by edge label and 
%   its elements give the necessary multiplicities. An input leg can 
%   be the last piece of an edge, whereas an output leg is always 
%   followed by another piece. And then the actual \emph{multiplicity} 
%   is one higher still, since the index starts at $0$.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set multL {}
   foreach e [lindex $NW(pure) 1] {lappend multL 1}
   foreach e [lindex $Opt(-region) 1] {
      set l [expr {$e % [llength $multL]}]
      set i [expr {$e / [llength $multL] * 2}]
      if {$l in [lindex $Opt(-region) 2]} then {incr i}
      lappend OL [expr {$l + [llength $multL]*$i}]
      if {$i+1 >= [lindex $multL $l]} then {
         lset multL $l [expr {$i+2}]
      }
   }
   foreach e [lindex $Opt(-region) 2] {
      set l [expr {$e % [llength $multL]}]
      set i [expr {$e / [llength $multL] * 2}]
      if {$l in [lindex $Opt(-region) 2]} then {incr i}
      lappend IL [expr {$l + [llength $multL]*$i}]
      if {$i >= [lindex $multL $l]} then {
         lset multL $l [expr {$i+1}]
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   With the multiplicities known, the |EC| array is filled in with 
%   the |raw| curves of the pieces. The index into this array is the 
%   extended edge label of the piece.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set l -1; foreach curve $NW(ecurve-Tk-raw) m $multL {incr l
      if {$m == 1} then {

      } else {

         foreach piece [subdivide_rawcurve $curve $m] {

%   and |colour| styles those edges which are in the region should be 
%   treated specially (not generate any code, or be coloured, 
%   respectively). The easiest way to achieve this is to remove their 
%   pieces from the |EC| array and instead put them in the |EC2| array. 
%   The easiest way of finding those pieces that are not legs seems to 
%   be to remove any piece incident with a vertex in the region, even if 
%   that means every piece will be looked at twice.
%   \begin{tcl}
   if {$Opt(-regionstyle) eq "gone" || $Opt(-regionstyle) eq "colour"} then {

         }
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Drawing the pieces is not so difficult.
%   \begin{tcl}
   foreach e [array names EC] {

%   \end{tcl}
%   Then comes the matter of the cutmarks. These are most easily 
%   located as endpoints of those curve pieces which are legs of the 
%   region. The |L| list constructed has the structure
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     \begin{regblock}[\regstar]
%       \word{$x$} \word{$y$} \word{$x'$} \word{$y'$}

% \begin{proc}{subdivide_rawcurve}
%   This procedure takes a |raw| curve and a positive integer as 
%   argument, subdivides the curve into that many pieces (of equal 
%   ``time'' duration), and returns the list of pieces (each a |raw| 
%   curve itself). The call syntax is
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     |network::rich::subdivide_rawcurve| \word{curve} \word{pieces}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   It should be observed that the pieces are returned in reverse 
%   order (highest time first), since that turns out to be what makes 
%   most sense for the intended application of subdividing an edge 
%   (other procedure generate edge curves going from head to tail, 
%   but in a subdivision it makes sense to have tailmost piece first).
%   
%   The idea for the algorithm is to go for the last subdivision 
%   time, and split the corresponding curve segment (computing a new 
%   knot and its associated control points). The second half of the 
%   split (and any subsequent segments) is immediately data for a 
%   piece. The first half of the split replaces the original segment 
%   (and any segments after it), and then the algorithm continues 
%   with the previous split. Working from the end is easier since the 
%   times are relative to the start of the coordinate list.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}

   } {$time > 1e-3} {
      set time [expr {$time - $step}]
   } {
%   \end{tcl}
%   Special case: if the time is less than $10^{-3}$ from an integer, 
%   then cut at the already existing knot. This means you can't cut a 
%   curve into thousands of pieces with this procedure, but doing 
%   that probably wouldn't have been a good idea anyway.
%   \begin{tcl}
      if {abs($time-round($time)) < 1e-3} then {
         set knot [expr {round($time)*6}]

         set stretch 1.0
         continue
      }
%   \end{tcl}

%   One basic problem is that of characters for which one would 
%   normally use a control sequence. The relationship between 
%   character and command are pretty arbitrary, so it is probably 
%   best done as a |string map|. This |licr_map| variable holds a 
%   mapping from characters to \LaTeX\ text counterparts.
%   
%   At the moment, this only does something for characters in the 
%   visible ASCII range, but one could consider extending it to 
%   larger character sets (\texttt{utf8enc.dfu} would be a good 
%   starting point for data about this mapping).
%   \begin{tcl}
namespace eval network::rich::topgf {
   variable licr_map {
      { } ~
%   \end{tcl}
%   Expressing spaces as |~| is primarily good for ensuring proper 
%   parsing, particularly avoiding that spaces are lost. It also 
%   prevents linebreaks, but that is probably enforced by a 
%   surrounding |\mbox| or |\fbox| anyway.
%   \begin{tcl}
      #   {\#}
      $   {\textdollar }
      %   {\%}
      &   {\&}
%   \end{tcl}
%   There might be a point in transforming the quotes as well, namely 
%   to prevent unintended ligatures, but that is not an urgent issue.
%   \begin{tcl}
      <   {\textless }
      >   {\textgreater }
      \\  {\textbackslash }
      ^   {\textasciicircum }
      _   {\textunderscore }
      \{  {\textbraceleft }
      |   {\textbar }
      \}  {\textbraceright }
      ~   {\textasciitilde }
   }
}
%   \end{tcl}
%   If this map yields unsatisfactory results, then the user should 
%   extend it.
% \end{variable}
% 
% \begin{proc}{text}
%   Tk |text| items are expressed using |\TR| commands (indeed, that 
%   command exists mainly to support |text| items).
%   
%   The options of |text| items are rather different from those 
%   handled by |_opts2state|, so it seems best to have an explicit 
%   parsing round.
%   \begin{tcl}

            nw {set anchor "north west"}
            c - ce - cen - cent - cente - center {
               set anchor center
            }
         }
      } -angle {
         set angle [string trimright\
           [string trimright [format %f $val] 0] .]
      } -fill {

      } -text {
         set labeltext [string map $licr_map $val]
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   The coordinates are on the other hand very straightforward. The 
%   most trouble is to handle spaces in arguments.
%   \begin{tcl}

   return [list {} [list $draw]]
}
%   \end{tcl}
% \end{proc}
% 
% \begin{proc}{_Tkfont}
%   This procedure converts a Tk font description to \LaTeX\ commands 
%   making an equivalent font selection. The call syntax is
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     |_Tkfont| \word{font description} \word{division}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   and the return value is just \LaTeX\ code.
%   
%   Since Tk implements several font description formats, matching it 
%   fully is a bit tricky. Right now only the option--value form is 
%   supported. Others could be supported through a helper command 
%   that converts to option--value form, as that could be shared with 
%   the SVG counterpart of this command.
%   
%   The settings for the various NFSS axes are collected in the |A| 
%   array, which contains actual setting commands.
%   \begin{tcl}
proc network::rich::topgf::_Tkfont {descr div} {
   dict for {opt val} $descr {
      switch -- $opt -family {
%   \end{tcl}
%   The standard families |Times|, |Helvetica|, and |Courier| are 
%   not taken literally, but rather as aliases for |\rmdefault|, 
%   |\sfdefault|, and |\ttdefault|. 
%   \begin{tcl}
         case -- $val Times {
            set A(family) {\fontfamily{\rmdefault}}
         } Courier {
            set A(family) {\fontfamily{\ttdefault}}
         } Times {
            set A(family) {\fontfamily{\sfdefault}}
         }
      } -size {
         if {$val>0} then {
            set A(size) "\\Fs\{[string trimright [string trimright\
              [format %f $val] 0] .]bp\}"
%   \end{tcl}
%   Yes, Tk points are translated to \TeX\ |bp|. The difference is 
%   tiny, but one might as well do it right.
%   \begin{tcl}
         } else {
            set A(size) [format {\Fs{%s}} [expr {-$val*$div}]]
         }
      } -weight {
         case -- $val normal {
            set A(series) {\fontseries{\mddefault}}
         } bold {
            set A(series) {\fontseries{\bfdefault}}
         }
      } -slant {
         case -- $val roman {
            set A(shape) {\fontshape{n}}
         } italic {
            set A(shape) {\fontshape{it}}
         }
      }
   }
%   \end{tcl}
%   Then the commands are combined into a command string, which sets 
%   the parameters in reverse order of how they appear in \TeX\ font 
%   command names.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set res [append A(size) ""][append A(shape) ""][append A(series) ""]
   append res [append A(family) ""] {\selectfont}
%   \end{tcl}
%   Finally some mappings are made to fold |\selectfont| into another 
%   command, if possible.
%   \begin{tcl}
   set res [string map {
      {\fontfamily{\rmdefault}\selectfont} {\rmfamily}
      {\fontfamily{\sfdefault}\selectfont} {\sffamily}

% \begin{proc}{layout_as_PGF}
%   The |layout_as_PGF| procedure produces \LaTeX\ code displaying the 
%   \emph{layout} of a rich network (but not the network as such). 
%   The rich network must have the following entries:
%   \begin{ttdescription}
%     \item[level-layout-Tk]
%       This is the basic source of information about the position of 
%       items in the network layout. Items are drawn as rectangles.
%     \item[pure]
%       Is used to translate vertex item numbers to decorations, so 
%       that their sizes can be determined.
%     \item[ecurve-Tk-raw]
%       This is used for determining links between levels: a link is 
%       a curve segment where the control points do not coincide with 
%       the knot points.
%     \item[bbox-Tk]
%       This provides the bounding box.
%   \end{ttdescription}
%   
%   The call syntax is
%   \begin{displaysyntax}
%     |network::rich::layout_as_PGF| \word{vertex-sizes} 
%     \begin{regblock}[\regplus] \word{option} \word{value} 
%     \end{regblock}
%   \end{displaysyntax}
%   where the \word{vertex-sizes} is, as with |make_level-layout-Tk|, 
%   a pattern--size list.
%   
%   The available options are
%   \begin{ttdescription}
%     \item[-val] Standard pass-network-by-value option.
%     \item[-var] Standard pass-network-by-variable option.
%     \item[-unit]
%       \LaTeX\ length corresponding to the unit in the network.
%     \item[-division]
%       The unit actually used in the result will be the value of 
%       |-unit| divided by the value of |-division|; setting 
%       |-division| to $2$ can avoid making a lot of coordinates 
%       ending in |.5|. Defaults to |1|.
%     \item[-itemboxcol]
%       The colour of item boxes. Defaults to |red|.
%     \item[-linkthickness]
%       The thickness of link lines. Defaults to not being set.
%   \end{ttdescription}
%   In addition, the |-edgew| and |-edgeh| options of 
%   |level-layout-Tk_defaults| are taken note of.
%   
%   \begin{tcl}
